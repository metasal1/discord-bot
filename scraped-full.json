Schengen Visa FAQ


What is a Schengen Visa?
The Netherlands is part of the Schengen Region. A Schengen visa is a short-stay visa that allows a person to travel to any member of the SCHENGEN AREA, including Netherlands and stay up to 90 days in a 180 day period for tourism or business purposes.

Click HERE to check if you need a Visa to travel to the Netherlands.


Where do I go to apply for a Schengen visa?
The issuance of a Schengen visa must be done at the consulate of the country considered to be its main destination, depending on the purpose of your trip and the length of stay, or in the first country of entry if it is the same length of stay in the different Schengen States.
Solana Foundation has engaged the assistance of Nomadic to provide you with directions on how to obtain the Schengen visa. Click HERE to answer a few questions about your travel plans and Nomadic will contact you with more detailed instructions on the visa application process. On the form, please list Breakpoint 2023 in the Trip Activities/Comments/Service Requested section.

Grizzlython is a global, online hackathon for the Solana ecosystem and community. If you're interested in dipping your toes into web3, this hackathon is the perfect opportunity to start your crypto journey from anywhere in the world. Register here!
Remember: Solana Hackathons are a little different than a traditional building event — they’re more like marathons than sprints. They are intended for serious builders and entrepreneurs to compete over a 6 week period in order to formulate a business idea, run through development, and have an opportunity to raise seed funding from crypto’s leading investors.
Do I need to register first before submitting a project?
Yes, please register here. If you are part of a team, each individual team member must register to be eligible for prizes.
A project submission form will be available near the end of the hackathon. In order to be eligible for any prizes, projects must complete the submission form.
Which projects are eligible to win a prize?
Grizzlython is a platform for new projects who are just starting and haven’t raised outside capital. It is not intended for established projects who have been building for months or years.
Projects cannot have started more than 30 days before Grizzlython registrations opens on Feb. 2, 2023 (no earlier than Jan. 3, 2023). Projects will only be judged on the code produced during the open and close dates of the hackathon (Feb. 2 - March 14, 2023).
SOLANA Foundation Hackathon Official Rules
Where can I access developer resources?
Check out the Resources section here. This page has all the tools, documentation, tutorials, and guides needed to start building today.
Where can I ask technical questions?
Head over to the #dev-questions channel in the Solana Hackathon Discord Server here.
Can I submit a project individually or do I need to join a team?
You may submit a project by yourself. However, we recommend reaching out to other participants who may add valuable skills to your project. Solana Hackathons are highly competitive and so we recommend joining up with others to develop your idea as much as possible.
If you need help finding teammates, we’ve got you! Find other builders in the official Grizzlython Find a Team directory.
Can I meet up with other hackathon participants in real life?
Yes! Ecosystem teams around the world are hosting coworking spaces running concurrently with the hackathon. Each is sponsored by a Solana ecosystem project that will be helping you through your hackathon journey, from project idea to getting started building on Solana. RSVP for one the global locations at solana.com/events.
Where can I find project ideas?
While participants are encouraged to come up with novel concepts, Superteam has created a repository of project ideas.
How will projects be judged?
Grizzlython project submissions will be judged on a variety of factors. After projects are submitted, they are evaluated by the team of judges to determine a shortlist based on code and their presentation or video. As Grizzlython is intended to be a speed run through the launch of a new project, it's important that all participants spend time finessing their marketing and presentation, as well their code.
All projects will be reviewed and judges will be consulting these questions as they evaluate:

Functionality: How well does this project work? What is the quality of code?
Potential Impact: How big is the total addressable market for this project? What will be the impact of this project on the broader Solana ecosystem?
Novelty: How unique is this project's concept?
UX: How well does this project utilize Solana's performance to create great UX for downstream users?
Open-source: Is this project open-source? How well does the project compose with other primitives in the Solana ecosystem?
Business Plan: Is there a viable business to be built around this project? Again, it is key to allocate enough time on your project presentation (slides or video)

After judges complete individual evaluations, the hackathon organizers will sync with the judges to choose the winners based on the project's weighted scores. Winners of the event will be announced within a month of the hackathon submission date.
I participated in LamportDAO's Sandstorm Hackathon. Can I enter the same project in Grizzlython?
If you participated in LamportDAO's Sandstorm Hackathon that ran shortly before the launch of Grizzlython, you are eligible to participate in Grizzlython and win prizes, assuming your project meets the other eligibility requirements.
However, projects will only be judged on the code and work produced during the open and close dates of Grizzlython (Feb. 2 - March 14, 2023).
If you participated in Sandstorm and are building an entirely new product, you are also eligible to participate and win Grizzlython prizes.
What is the Grizzlython Code of Conduct?
The Grizzlython Hackathon welcomes anyone from around the world to participate and is intended to create an inclusive environment for building, collaboration, creativity, and impact. We value the participation of each member of the community and want everyone involved to be respected. Accordingly, hackathon administrators, judges, and participants are expected to adhere to the Code of Conduct outlined below for the duration of the hackathon. Event organizers will enforce this code and have the right to disqualify any individual or team that breaks the code.
Be Respectful: Be kind to all who participate in the event. Do not insult or put down other attendees.
Behave Professionally. Remember that harassment, racism, sexism, or exclusionary jokes are not appropriate for this event.

The requests are serviced by aptly named RPC Nodes, which are typically dedicated to the task rather than participating in consensus. Nevertheless, from an application user’s perspective, poor RPC performance is no different from poor cluster performance. To give your users a great experience and show off Solana’s speed and low-latency, it is important to have RPC infrastructure that is up to the task.
Development: Developers are encouraged to use a local cluster during development, especially in the early stages and for testing. Local clusters are more flexible than the public offerings, granting the freedom to run unoptimized early iterations. The easiest way to run a local cluster is with the solana-test-validator binary, included in the Solana CLI Tools suite. Once the application reaches a stable state, deploying on a public cluster becomes more appropriate.
Like all code optimization tasks, when it comes to RPC requests, less is more. Avoid making frequent, repetitive calls for the same data. Avoid building clients that make RPC requests directly. “Backend-less dApps” are a myth; you are just pummelling someone else’s infrastructure. Cache expensive calls (especially getProgramAccounts, getSignaturesForAddress2, and getConfirmedBlock) in an app-optimized way and serve your users from the cache. Taking the time to optimize your code before going live can save you a lot of headaches from poor user experience reports, and can significantly reduce your infrastructure spend.
Free Services
Several providers offer free RPC access to the public Solana clusters. These services are good for real-world testing, early demos, and small, private beta programs. Keep in mind that you get exactly what you are paying for. Free services typically do not autoscale, are rate-limited, offer no SLA, and are not afraid to ban abusers. When an application is ready to be opened to the public, it is time to invest in private RPC access.

Private Services
Due to the variability in RPC requirements between applications, generalized public RPC infrastructure rarely fits the bill. To ensure users get a good experience, public facing applications need to secure their own private RPC access. This will allow you to autoscale based on user demand, relax rate limits according to your application, and have peace of mind that other applications’ users won’t crowd yours out. Several organizations offer high-availability, on-demand RPC services; see below. If none of the providers are a good fit and you’re up to the task of running your own RPC service, please reach out to the Solana Foundation for guidance.

" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :"Staking OverviewOn the Solana network, many different people and
entities run a program on specialized computers known as
a validator. Validators play a key role in maintaining
and securing the Solana blockchain. Validators are
responsible for processing new incoming transactions on
the network, as well as for voting on and appending new
blocks to the blockchain.
As different validators around the world may receive
different pieces of information at different times, it
is essential that the network is able to come to
agreement about which transactions and data are
continually added to the blockchain. The strategy by
which the validators and the entire network come to this
agreement is known as the consensus mechanism, and is a
core challenge to building a successful decentralized
blockchain network. Many different projects have
attempted various solutions on how to reach consensus in
a fast and cost-efficient manner.
The Solana network uses a Proof-of-Stake consensus
mechanism (often abbreviated to PoS). Every validator on
the network has an opportunity to participate in
consensus by casting votes for which blocks they believe
should be added to the blockchain, thereby confirming
any valid transactions contained in those particular
blocks. However, not all validator’s votes are weighted
equally.
Validator’s consensus votes are stake-weighted, meaning
the more stake an individual validator has, the more
influence that one validator has in determining the
outcome of the consensus voting. Similarly, validators
with less stake have less weight in determining the vote
outcome, and validators with no stake cannot influence
the outcome of a consensus vote.Staking is the process by which a SOL token holder (such
as someone who purchased SOL tokens on an exchange)
assigns some or all of their tokens to a particular
validator or validators, which helps increase those
validators’ voting weight. Assigning your tokens to add
to a validator’s stake-weight is known as “delegating”
your tokens. Delegating your tokens to a validator does
NOT give the validator ownership or control over your
tokens. At all times, you still control all your staked
tokens that you may have chosen to delegate.
By staking tokens with a validator or validators, the
token holder indicates a degree of trust in the
validator they chose to delegate to. As validators amass
larger amounts of stake delegations from different token
holders, this acts as “proof” to the network that the
validator’s consensus votes are trustworthy, and their
votes are therefore weighted proportionally to the
amount of stake the validator has attracted. By weighing
the collective votes from all validators against the
proportion of stake that has been delegated to them, the
network reaches consensus by this Proof of Stake.In an open and decentralized network like Solana, anyone
can run a validator if they choose. A malicious
validator or other bad actor could attempt to attack the
network or to submit incorrect or fraudulent
transactions for their own gain. Because of the
Proof-of-Stake consensus mechanism described above, a
single entity acting alone in this fraudulent manner
would need to attract some amount of stake before any of
their proposed activities would be weighed in the
consensus vote.
As more token holders choose to stake their SOL tokens
to different validators across the network, and the
total amount of stake on the network increases, it
becomes increasingly difficult for even a coordinated
and well-funded attacker to amass enough stake to
single-handedly alter the outcome of a consensus vote
for their own benefit.
In short, the more stake that is delegated to many
different validators across the network, the more safe
and secure the network becomes for all of its users.
Additionally, token holders who choose to stake their
tokens and help secure the network in doing so, are
eligible to receive staking rewards once they have
delegated their tokens to one or more validators. More
details on staking rewards are found below.On many Proof-of-Stake networks, there exists a
mechanism known as “slashing”. Slashing is any process
by which some portion of stake delegated to a validator
is destroyed as a punitive measure for malicious actions
undertaken by the validator.
This mechanism incentivizes validators not to undertake
such actions, as less stake delegated to a validator
means that validator then accrues fewer rewards. Being
slashed can also be seen as a reputational risk for
retaining current or attracting potential future stake.
Slashing also poses a risk to token holders who could
potentially lose some of their tokens if they have
delegated to a validator which gets slashed. The
presence of slashing could incentivize token holders to
only delegate their tokens to validators they feel are
reputable, and not to delegate all their tokens to a
single or small number of validators.
On Solana, slashing is not automatic. If an attacker
causes the network to halt, they can be slashed upon
network restart. For more information, please check out
our docs.Anyone who holds SOL can stake their tokens at any time.To stake SOL tokens, you must use a wallet that supports
staking. Not all wallets support staking at this time.
SolFlare.com is one user-friendly wallet that supports
staking. Check out the official docs for a list of wallets which support staking.
SOL tokens in your wallet must first be moved into a
stake account. You can create as many stake accounts as
you like, and deposit as much or as little SOL into each
stake account as you want. Each new stake account has a
unique address, and a single wallet can manage or
“authorize” many different stake accounts. Check out our
docs on stake account structure
for more details.
In order to earn staking rewards (if inflation is
enabled on Mainnet Beta), the tokens in a stake account
must be delegated to a validator. A single stake account
can only be delegated to a single validator at any time,
so if you want to delegate to different validators you
will need to split your tokens between multiple stake
accounts.Yes. Some people may have received a stake account with
locked up tokens from the Solana Foundation that was
distributed in exchange for services. Tokens in stake
accounts with a lockup may not be withdrawn to another
wallet address before the lockup expires, but they may
still be delegated to a validator to potentially earn
staking rewards during this time. Rewards earned on
locked tokens are deposited back into the locked stake
account.When you first create a stake account, you specify how
many SOL tokens you want to fund it with, and these
tokens are withdrawn from your main wallet account and
deposited into the new stake account.
Tokens can also be transferred into a pre-existing stake
account at any time, by using your wallet’s Transfer or
Send feature and providing the address of your stake
account. If you transfer tokens into a stake account
that is already delegated, these new tokens will not
automatically be delegated.
If you have a delegated stake account and you wish to
increase your delegation to a particular validator, the
best practice is to create a new stake account with the
additional amount of stake and delegate that account to
the same validator.
Example: Increasing the stake delegated to a single
validator

User has a wallet with 1000 SOL balance.
User uses the wallet interface to create a stake
account with 100 SOL, then delegates the tokens in the
stake account to Validator A.
Wallet balance is now 900 SOL and the wallet also
controls a stake account with a balance of 100 SOL.
The stake account shows in the wallet interface and on
the Explorer that it is “Activating”. Once it is
“Active”, the staked tokens are eligible for rewards.
See Timing Considerations for more details.
Later, the user wants to increase their delegation to
Validator A, so uses the wallet interface to create a
second stake account with 50 SOL, then delegates the
tokens in the new stake account to Validator A.
Wallet balance is now 850 SOL and the wallet also
controls 2 stake accounts with 100 and 50 SOL,
respectively, each delegated to Validator A.

If you transfer tokens into a stake account that is
already delegated, these new tokens will not
automatically be delegated. In order to get these new
tokens also delegated and earning rewards, you would
need to un-delegate the entire account, then re-delegate
the same account. As un-delegating and re-delegating
can take several days to take effect, your original stake would not be earning rewards
during this transition period.
Therefore, we recommend only transferring SOL into a
stake account when it is first created or otherwise not
delegated.Tokens can only be withdrawn from a stake account when
they are not currently delegated. When a stake account
is first un-delegated, it is considered “deactivating”
or “cooling down”. Tokens may not be withdrawn from the
account until some or all of them have finished
deactivating and are considered “inactive” and therefore
no longer earning any potential staking rewards. For
details on how long this transition period may take,
please see Timing Considerations.
Once the tokens in a stake account are inactive, they
can be withdrawn back to your main wallet address or to
another address immediately.
Example: Withdrawing all tokens from a stake account

User has a wallet with a balance of 900 SOL, and a
single stake account with 100 SOL delegated to a
validator.
User uses the wallet interface to Deactivate their
stake delegation. The stake account shows in the
wallet interface and on the Explorer that it is
“Deactivating”. Once it is “Inactive” or “Not
Delegated”, the staked tokens stop earning rewards and
can be withdrawn. See Timing Considerations for more details.
User can use the wallet interface to withdraw their
all tokens back into their main wallet account. The
wallet balance now shows 1,000 SOL and the stake
account is closed.

If you want to reduce the amount of delegated stake
assigned to a given validator without deactivating your
entire balance (and therefore missing any potential
rewards during the delegation downtime), you can Split
an existing stake account into two accounts, and
undelegate one, while leaving the other account
delegated and continuously eligible for rewards.
Example: Reducing the delegation staked to a given
validator

User has a wallet with a balance of 800 SOL, and a
single stake account with 200 SOL delegated to a
validator.
User wants to reduce the amount of stake delegated to
the validator by 100 SOL.
Use the wallet interface to “Split” the stake account,
and specifies 100 SOL as the amount to split.
There are now 2 stake accounts, each with 100 SOL
which are each delegated to the same validator.
User can then use the wallet interface to Deactivate
one of their stake delegations. The stake account
shows in the wallet interface and on the Explorer that
it is “Deactivating”. Once it is “Inactive” or “Not
Delegated”, the staked tokens stop earning rewards and
can be withdrawn. See Timing Considerations for more details.
Once the account is Inactive, the user can then choose
to delegate the account to a different validator, or
to withdraw the tokens back into the main wallet, or
to further split the inactive stake account and
delegate to multiple different validators.

Tokens in a stake account with a lockup may not be
withdrawn until the lockup expires, regardless of the
delegation state of that account. Once the lockup
expires, undelegated tokens may be withdrawn
immediately. There is no action required by the account
holder to specifically unlock the account.When you delegate or un-delegate a stake account, the
tokens do not change state immediately. Newly delegated
tokens are considered “activating” or “warming up”, and
are not eligible to earn rewards until they are fully
activated. Newly un-delegated tokens are considered
“deactivating” or “cooling down” and are not able to be
withdrawn until deactivated.
The Solana protocol only allows stake tokens to finish
changing state at the beginning of a new epoch. An epoch
is approximately 2 days long. Use solana epoch-info to
see details of the current epoch.
If you delegate tokens in a stake account in the middle
of an epoch, the tokens will appear in your wallet as
“activating” until the current epoch ends, at which
point they will be active and eligible to earn rewards.
Whether you delegate your stake tokens near the
beginning of the current epoch, or near the end of the
current epoch does not impact when the tokens will
become active, which is only at the next epoch boundary.
The same logic applies to un-delegating or deactivating
a delegated stake account. Deactivating tokens cannot be
withdrawn until they have finished deactivating at the
epoch boundary.
There is a limit to how much total stake can change
state in a single epoch across the entire Solana
network. No more than 25% of the total active stake on
the network can be activated or deactivated in a single
epoch. In a scenario where more than 25% of the total
active take on the network is being activated in a
single epoch, a portion of all activating/deactivating
stake up to the global 25% limit, will finish changing
state at the first epoch boundary. The remaining stake
would stay as “activating” or “deactivating” for at
least one more epoch, until the next epoch boundary.
If a stake activation takes multiple epochs, the portion
of stake that becomes fully active at the first epoch
boundary is eligible for rewards, while the remaining
portion that is still activating for an additional epoch
is not yet eligible for rewards.
Similarly, if a stake deactivation takes multiple
epochs, the portion of stake that becomes fully inactive
at the first epoch boundary becomes able to be
withdrawn, while the remaining portion is still
deactivating for an additional epoch, at which point it
can then be withdrawn.All stake accounts on Solana (and all accounts of any
variety) can be viewed on Solana’s network explorer,
found here:
Solana Explorer
Copy and paste the stake account address of interest in
the main search bar of the explorer to see details of
the account, including its
activation/deactivation/delegation status, current
balance, and the address of the stake account’s
authorities, which would usually be the same as your
wallet’s main address.
Depending on which wallet solution you use to manage
your stake accounts, this same information may be
visible by logging in to your wallet and viewing your
stake accounts.Staking RewardsStaking rewards are computed and issued once per epoch.
An epoch is approximately 2 days long. Rewards accrued
in a given epoch are issued to all validators and
delegators in the first block of the following epoch.
Staking yield is presented as an annualized figure,
though this number varies each epoch as the inflation
rate and total active stake continually change. Staking
yield and the full inflation design is detailed in our
official docs here.

Estimates of Staking Yield, given various models of the
fraction of total SOL staked, can be explored here:
Staking Yield Models
To estimate the amount of SOL a delegator can expect to
see in a single epoch in a single stake account:
Validator Uptime is defined by a validator’s consensus
voting behavior. For each time a validator votes on a
block that is ultimately appended to the blockchain,
that validator earns one Vote Credit.
When rewards are tallied at the end of the epoch, all
the stake-weighted vote credits earned by all the
validators are used to determine the total amount of SOL
that is issued to each particular validator and their
delegators.Validators charge a fee on inflationary rewards earned
by the stake accounts that are delegated to them, in
exchange for their services in securing the blockchain
and processing transactions. This fee is known as the
commission rate. Each time rewards are issued, the
commission is deposited in the validator’s account and
the remaining rewards are deposited in all of the stake
accounts that are delegated to that validator,
proportionally to the amount of actively delegated stake
in each account. Validator commission and staking
rewards are always issued simultaneously.Rewards are issued once per epoch and are deposited into
the stake account that earned them. Stake rewards are
automatically re-delegated as active stake.
If the rewards due to a validator or one of their stakes
is less than one lamport for a given epoch, reward
issuance is deferred until the next epoch in which both
would receive at least one lamport.EconomicsThe details of the originally proposed inflation
schedule are discussed here. The specific parameters
that determine the inflation schedule are:

Initial Inflation Rate: 8 %
Dis-inflation Rate: −15%
Long-term Inflation Rate: 1.5%

The above parameters are defined as:

Initial Inflation Rate: The starting Inflation Rate
for when inflation is first enabled. The token
issuance rate can only decrease from this amount
Dis-inflation Rate: The annualized rate at which the
Inflation Rate is reduced
Long-term Inflation Rate: The stable, long-term
Inflation Rate to be expected

Note that the inflation rate will not be the same as the
staking yield (i.e. the interest earned by staking
tokens). See below for a discussion of staking yield.100% of the inflationary issuances are proposed to be
delivered to delegated stake accounts and validators.A proposal for a community driven governance process to
enable inflation has been proposed here.
The timeline of expected events can be seen at the
bottom of that post.Staking yield comes from inflationary issuances being
distributed across delegated staking accounts and
validator vote accounts per the validator commission
rate. Due to this design, the staking yield is to be
primarily a function of the fraction of SOL that is
staked on the network. A detailed discussion of the
design and its impact on staking yield can be found
here:
Inflation Design Overview
The amount of total SOL that will be staked is unknown,
so we can only estimate the exact staking yields. Below,
we show staking yields over time segmented by different
values of the percent of staked SOL that might be
observed on the network (between 60-90%). The inflation
schedule parameters are set as described above.

A simple interactive dashboard is provided here,
in which different % of staked SOL can be selected to
see the impact on prospective staking yields.
Please note that this is an idealized Staked Yield as it
neglects validator uptime impact on rewards, validator
commissions, potential yield throttling and potential
slashing incidents. It additionally ignores that % of
Staked SOL is dynamic by design, i.e. it is expected
that the % of staked SOL changes over time thus
impacting the staking yield over time. It is only
presented to be used as a rough estimate for expected
staking yields.As the number of nodes on Mainnet Beta continues to
grow, the Solana Foundation is committed to continuing
to delegate 100M SOL to be split evenly among qualified
validators. In order to increase growth to up to 500
individual nodes, which will help increase the security
of the network, qualified validators will receive
Foundation delegations of up to 200,000 SOL.

DISPUTE RESOLUTION
**Please read the following section carefully because it requires you to
arbitrate certain disputes and claims with the Foundation and limits the
manner in which you can seek relief from us, unless you opt out of
arbitration by following the instructions set forth below. No class or
representative actions or arbitrations are allowed under this
arbitration provision. **In addition,
arbitration precludes you from suing in court or having a jury trial. **
(a) No Representative Actions. You and the Foundation agree that any
dispute arising out of or related to this EULA or the Service is
personal to you and the Foundation and that any dispute will be
resolved solely through individual action, and will not be brought
as a class arbitration, class action or any other type of
representative proceeding.
(b) Arbitration of Disputes. You and the Foundation waive your
rights to a jury trial and to have any other dispute arising out of
or related to this EULA and the Service, including claims related to
privacy and data security, (collectively, “Disputes”) resolved in
court. Instead, for any Dispute that you have against the
Foundation you agree to first contact the Foundation and attempt to
resolve the claim informally by sending a written notice of your
claim (“Notice”) to the Foundation by email at
operations@solana.foundation or by certified mail addressed to
Industriestrasse 47, 6300 Zug, Switzerland. The Notice must (a)
include your name, residence address, email address, and telephone
number; (b) describe the nature and basis of the Dispute; and (c)
set forth the specific relief sought. Our notice to you will be
similar in form to that described above. If you and the Foundation
cannot reach an agreement to resolve the Dispute within thirty (30)
days after such Notice is received, then either party may submit the
Dispute to binding arbitration administered by JAMS or, under the
limited circumstances set forth above, in court. All Disputes
submitted to JAMS will be resolved through confidential, binding
arbitration before one arbitrator. Arbitration proceedings will be
held in Zug, Switzerland. You and the Foundation agree that Disputes
will be held in accordance with the JAMS Streamlined Arbitration
Rules and Procedures (“JAMS Rules”). The most recent version of
the JAMS Rules are available on the JAMS
website
and are hereby incorporated by reference. You either acknowledge and
agree that you have read and understand the JAMS Rules or waive your
opportunity to read the JAMS Rules and waive any claim that the JAMS
Rules are unfair or should not apply for any reason.
(c) You and the Foundation agree that these Terms affect interstate
commerce and that the enforceability of this Section will be
substantively and procedurally governed by the Federal Arbitration
Act, 9 U.S.C. § 1, et seq. (the “FAA”), to the maximum extent
permitted by applicable law. As limited by the FAA, these Terms and
the JAMS Rules, the arbitrator will have exclusive authority to make
all procedural and substantive decisions regarding any Dispute and
to grant any remedy that would otherwise be available in court,
including the power to determine the question of arbitrability. The
arbitrator may conduct only an individual arbitration and may not
consolidate more than one individual’s claims, preside over any type
of class or representative proceeding or preside over any proceeding
involving more than one individual.
(d) The arbitration will allow for the discovery or exchange of
non-privileged information relevant to the Dispute. The arbitrator,
the Foundation, and you will maintain the confidentiality of any
arbitration proceedings, judgments and awards, including information
gathered, prepared and presented for purposes of the arbitration or
related to the Dispute(s) therein. The arbitrator will have the
authority to make appropriate rulings to safeguard confidentiality,
unless the law provides to the contrary. The duty of confidentiality

shall be severed from these Terms; (b) severance of the
unenforceable or unlawful provision shall have no impact whatsoever
on the remainder of this Section or the parties’ ability to compel
arbitration of any remaining claims on an individual basis pursuant
to this Section; and (c) to the extent that any claims must
therefore proceed on a class, collective, consolidated, or
representative basis, such claims must be litigated in a civil court
of competent jurisdiction and not in arbitration, and the parties
agree that litigation of those claims shall be stayed pending the
outcome of any individual claims in arbitration. Further, if any
part of this Section is found to prohibit an individual claim
seeking public injunctive relief, that provision will have no effect
to the extent such relief is allowed to be sought out of
arbitration, and the remainder of this Section will be enforceable.

For the last several years, you’ve probably heard quite a bit about the blockchain… but it’s very easy to get lost. It can sound a lot like people are speaking another language!
If you’re here, welcome — you’re taking the first step towards learning. This guide will help you learn some of the basic blockchain concepts so you can start participating in the future of the internet.
What exactly IS the blockchain?
At its core, the blockchain is a ledger — a series of records and data points, like a spreadsheet or old accounting book.
Unlike spreadsheets or old books, though, the blockchain is decentralized — instead of it being stored in one place, it’s stored across different computers across a network and around the world. Essentially, there’s no single book that can be easily lost or updated. Instead, the data is verified by checking the blocks (or bundles of transactions) across different validator nodes.
There are a few different blockchain protocols that people can use, such as Solana, Bitcoin, and many, many others. People can use blockchain technology as a way to store data, value, and — in the case of Solana and certain other protocols, run programs.
How does that relate to cryptocurrency?
Well, let’s start with some definitions first. Cryptography is the art of keeping things secure. You’ve probably encountered this before, through encrypted data and passwords.
Cryptocurrency, then, is a type of currency that is based on cryptography. Rather than the ledger being centralized, transactions are decentralized — there’s no single authority validating everything — and as secure as other encrypted data. The translation? It’s a very safe way of storing data and value with no choke points or central points of failure and which is very difficult to manipulate.
So what exactly is a coin? What is a token? What’s the difference between coins and tokens?
All blockchain protocols have coins that represent value and can be traded. On Solana, this coin is called SOL.
Tokens, meanwhile, are built by individual projects on top of a base blockchain protocol. All blockchain projects are “tokenized,” and the Solana protocol is open for anyone to build their own tokens on top of it. Tokens are used to actually do stuff on the blockchain through trading, including executing “smart contracts.”
Okay, wait. What is a smart contract?
A smart contract is a contract that is written into the code of a blockchain and executed automatically when terms are met. It’s something that Solana and certain other protocols can do, but some other blockchains — most notably Bitcoin — cannot.
Think of a regular contract like a housing lease agreement. You pay rent; in exchange, you have a place to live. If you no longer have a place to live, you no longer pay rent; if you don’t pay rent, you’ll be kicked out. In a regular contract, the execution depends on the humans. A tenant fulfills their obligations of the lease and monitors that a landlord fulfills theirs, and vice versa.
With a smart contract, however, that execution is hardcoded in software, and software determines when conditions are met. That allows people to build some really cool functionality and dApps.
DApps? What are dApps?
A dApp is a decentralized application, or app that uses smart contracts. Any crypto program — like a marketplace, blockchain game, or tool used for DAO governance — is a dApp.
DApps are the tools you use to do things on the blockchain, whether that’s buying some art, voting in your decentralized organization, paying without intermediaries, or participating in decentralized finance.
And what is web3?
Web3 is the next iteration of the internet. Each iteration of the internet has been based on specific ideas: If web 1.0 was static websites and hyperlinking (like AOL or GeoCities) and web2 was social media (like Twitter, Facebook, and so on), web3 is built around the idea of decentralization.
Instead of an internet controlled by a handful of powerful, large platforms, web3 is built around the idea of a diffuse internet that anyone can support and control. Think of it as a return to early internet values — web3 is an era that removes gatekeepers and centralized “news feed” silliness.
It’s a world that can be built on the blockchain, using smart contracts.
Oooookay, so I think I’m starting to get this. So what exactly is the advantage of all this decentralization?
When the network isn’t controlled by a single entity, that means…

People who traditionally haven’t had access to banking have the ability to participate in the financial system.
You can pay for your favorite coffee without any fees or intermediaries.
Networks can’t be compromised or shut down due to one large controlling entity, like a nation state or powerful platform.
Users themselves can easily have a stake or buy into the platforms they are using, voting on the future of a video game metaverse.
And much more.

That’s the really exciting part of all this. It’s all extremely early in the web3 revolution, and you can watch it all happen and be a part of it — because web3 is all about community and participation. All these use cases are being built right now by developers around the world and you can help out by joining in.
Why Solana?
This is the cool part — Solana is engineered for widespread, mainstream use by being energy efficient, lightning fast, and extremely inexpensive.
Many of the core Solana builders, like co-founder Anatoly Yakavenko, have a background in building cell phone networks. That means that they are singularly focused on building for scalability (the ability to grow) and efficiency (the ability to get the most information across with the least amount of resources). They believe that in order for people to build the projects that will get the public using blockchain technology, you need to make it as easy and painless as possible for people to experiment and use the technology as possible.
Some of the current leading blockchain technologies use energy-hogging, time-consuming mining — or solving very complex calculations — to validate security, and have fees that can range into the hundreds of dollars per transaction. Solana uses what’s called proof of stake to validate information — there’s no mining involved — and a special innovation called proof of history on top of that that allows it to validate even quicker. That makes it extremely efficient, using energy at the same scale as a few Google searches and significantly less energy than other regular household uses like running your refrigerator. Transaction fees, which are used to maintain blockchain networks and have ballooned elsewhere, are a fraction of a cent on Solana.
All of that translates into projects and tools built on Solana that can be as frictionless and easy to use as the rest of the internet, for both developers and users.

What happens when a group of people want to buy the constitution, or supply aid
to a nation at war? They set up a DAO — a new way of setting up an organization
through crypto. 

But what exactly is a DAO? What is “governance?” What does it all mean? 

Don’t worry. This guide will help walk you through some basics of a DAO so you
can start getting organized yourself.
What is a DAO?
DAOs are how groups of people control shared assets on the blockchain.
In the simplest terms, a DAO, or “decentralized autonomous organization,” is a
way people can organize through the blockchain. They do that by giving members
access to special tokens, which allow people to vote.
What do you mean by “assets on the blockchain?”
Assets can actually be pretty broad here, according to TK TITLE Sebastian Bors
at Solana Labs. “An asset,” he says, “can be anything.”
Some of the more notable examples of assets include the attempt by a DAO to
purchase an original copy of the Constitution to a DAO
that managed donations to Ukraine
, but an asset can also be something a little bit more abstract. An asset can be
the rules of a community, or the direction of a video game metaverse.
Think of a DAO as more of a way to organize people towards a common goal.
How does a DAO differ from a traditional organization?
There are a lot of advantages to organizing as a DAO instead of, say, a
traditional organization, says Bors. A key difference? Total transparency.
“Everything that is the DAO is defined as the contract on the chain,” he said.
Say you and a group of people wanted to raise money for a good cause — let’s say
fighting climate change. Traditionally, someone would set up a fundraising page
and designate one person or account as the one who controls it — linking that
person’s bank account, email, and so on.
Normally, that requires a lot of trust. You have to be able to trust that this
person is who they say they are, they’ll do what they say they’re going to do
with that money, and that institution that the money ends up going to is one you
actually want to support. 

DAOs build trust with transparency. With a DAO, Bors explains, “you have athe
clear governance structure that can decide what happens with the funds that are
collected.”
A DAO organized to help fight climate change would be linked to something called
a multi-signature wallet, which is controlled by the members of the DAO
instead of just one person. Anyone who is part of the DAO gets a governance
token which allows them to vote not only on proposals for the multi-sig wallet,
but also directions the community will take. Will you donate the money in the
wallet to fund refrigerant destruction? Will you use it to purchase — and then
shut down — a coal power plant?
Wait, what’s a multisignature wallet or governance token?
A multisignature wallet is a wallet that requires more than one private key to
make decisions. This may be a bit extreme, but think of launching a rocket — it
requires multiple keys to turn the ignition and take off.
A governance token, on the other hand, is the key for that rocket launch. If
you have a key, you can have a say in how the wallet, project, or community is
run. Essentially, it gives you a say in decision making._ _
Can the average person use a DAO?
DAOs are a great way for normal people to organize towards a shared goal, but
DAOs are still in their early days. Many of the tools for voting and organizing
are still somewhat technical. Similarly, legal recognition of DAOs is still
somewhat limited (the only state in the U.S. where you can legally incorporate a
DAO is Wyoming, for example).
But the space is rapidly evolving and there are several teams and projects in
the Solana ecosystem that are making DAOs easier for the layperson! The
opportunities here for individuals are growing rapidly, said Bors. He thinks
that small scale DAOs will help families protect their assets from the current
one person, one wallet crypto setup. He describes a potential example of
creating a “family locker” DAO for him and his wife and kids as a way to better
protect their digital assets better than the current one individual, one wallet
set-up.
“Everybody has one vote, and we put all the tokens that we own together. So that
means that if anything happened to me, my wife and kids can still have access to
that.”
Why are DAOs important?
DAOs can exist on a spectrum, Bors says. On one hand, you can have the simple
examples above like a charity DAO or a family locker — but the possibilities are
endless.

“It can be like the future of any company that you can create, because DAOs make
this transparent structure where everybody has ownership in the organization. 
There is still exploration, new ideas, and solutions coming everyday,” Bors
says. “We are all in this fantastic exploration stage right now.” 

Sounds like a good opportunity to do some experimenting." }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :"Welcome to No Bad Questions, a series that helps answer some basic questions about blockchain, crypto, and web3.
It seems like you can’t go anywhere on the internet these days without hearing about NFTs. Contrary to popular belief, NFTs aren’t just pictures of apes — it’s an exciting new functionality which could change the internet. But unless you cut through the jargon, it’s hard to see their potential.
“Fundamental innovations in the history of computing are being introduced to the world through art projects” says Stephen Hess, CEO of Metaplex Studios, which provides a standard NFT protocol for Solana projects. “I don't think that people are fully aware that's happening and how profound that is.”
This guide will help you understand how NFTs work, and how you can get started.
What exactly is an NFT?
NFT stands for “non-fungible token.” But that name is a bit confusing, right? Let’s break it down.
“Non-fungible” means that something is unique and cannot be replaced. Say you have a copy of a book. You could easily swap it out with another copy of the same book. Or a dollar bill — they’re all fungible, it doesn’t matter which you hold. But say it was a limited edition of the book that is now out of print, or it was given to you by someone special, or you wrote your name in it. That now makes it unique and special – and therefore non-fungible and can’t just be swapped out for any other book!
“Token” refers to a token on a blockchain, such as Solana. Many blockchain protocols allow people to build tokens on top of them, which can be capped at a certain amount or unlimited. Tokens can be used to represent things — think of the tickets you use to go on rides at a carnival, or a certificate of authenticity.
Together, an NFT is a unique token that cannot be swapped out, that is decentrally stored on the blockchain.
“More precisely,” says Hess, “that means a digital asset that you can own through your online identity within web3.”
Are NFTs just paying for a jpeg? Can’t I just save a copy?
Not exactly. The most important feature of NFTs is that they are unique – and the uniqueness is recognized by everyone else on the blockchain.
And while some of the most famous NFT projects are related to generative profile pictures (or PFPs) that are popular to trade among enthusiasts, an NFT can really be anything, says Hess. “There's a wide variety of use cases that NFTs are now finding for themselves.”
For example, an NFT can be a profile picture, like from the popular Degenerate Ape Academy project. It can also be an item in a video game, like the starships in Star Atlas. It can be a short looping animation, a video, a photo… most any sort of digital asset! It could even represent a loan, or proof you bought a ticket to a concert!
What can you do with an NFT?
Once you can prove something is unique, you can prove something can be linked to a specific wallet. This type of uniqueness and ownership is a huge deal in the digital world. The idea of ownership on the internet has been very fuzzy — meme accounts stealing jokes, bots stealing art to make tee shirts and profit, and countless other stories of people whose online works have been reproduced.
And once you establish unique digital ownership, you can build some very interesting functionality.

Several NFT projects have started DAOs, or decentralized communities, that share a treasury and work towards goals. The DeGods NFT project purchased a basketball team; several other NFT projects launched their own validator nodes to secure the greater Solana network.
Hess suggests that NFTs could serve as a form of digital identity going forward, replacing current login systems that require accounts on web2 companies like Facebook and Google. “I think that when you login in the future,” he says, “you likely will log in with an NFT.”
Atlas Cafe in San Francisco teamed up with Solana Pay to launch a special, limited-edition NFT that gave users a discount on products in the store.
Lollapalooza created an NFT series that, when collected, allows attendees to unlock VIP ticket upgrades or merchandise.
“As for media and music,” Hess also says, “I think we will see both tokenized access for content and content itself being sold as discrete units through NFTs.”

And that’s just the tip of the iceberg.
“I think when you look closer,” said Hess, “what you see are the beginnings of web3 communities and decentralized social networking.”
How do you get an NFT?
You can get an NFT a few different ways — you can “mint” an NFT directly from an NFT project, you can purchase one on a marketplace, or you can be given one. All of these methods require a wallet.
To mint an NFT, all you need to do is connect your wallet to the project page when NFTs are available, pay the minting and minor processing fees. As long as it’s available and all goes well, once you purchase it, the NFT will be in your wallet!
Purchasing an NFT from a marketplace is a great way to get an NFT directly from an NFT owner. Users set the price they want for the NFT, and you can buy it.
How do I make my own NFT?
If you’re an artist who wants to create an NFT, minting an NFT can be very easy. At the most basic level, all you need is…

A wallet.
The art file (or files).
A description.
A small amount of cryptocurrency to pay processing fees (on Solana, these fees are a few cents or even a fraction of a cent).

“I would encourage anyone that's interested in building in the Solana ecosystem, or building an NFT project, to take a look at Metaplex and the tools that we provide,” Hess says. Metaplex provides a number of tools to help artists create their projects — which can range from simply minting your NFT to creating your own customized storefront for your community. Each tool is different and supports different uses — so be sure to check out their guides for each individual tool.
Get building!" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :"Welcome to No Bad Questions, a series that helps answer some basic questions
about blockchain, crypto, and web3.
Earlier this year, the Solana Labs team
announced Solana Pay, a new
protocol for payments on Solana. It’s exciting news!
... unless you’re one of the many, many people who have no idea what it means.
For merchants and consumers alike, that announcement might as well be another
language. What are payments on Solana? Does that just mean paying with crypto?
Not even close. Payments in the crypto space is a new, exciting way to exchange
for goods and services. But don’t worry — there are no bad questions. After
doing some research and talking to Sheraz Shere, head of payments at Solana
Labs, we have the answers. Let’s break it down.
What exactly are “digital payments”?
TLDR: Digital payments use digital currencies to pay for goods and services.
Does this just mean paying for things with cryptocurrency?
Not exactly, says Shere. “This is about building a new set of payment and
commerce rails for merchants,” he says, “that happen to use the blockchain.” 

While there are plenty of tools that people can use to pay for real-life items
and goods with cryptocurrency, blockchain payments mean that people can use the
underlying technology for more secure payments without intermediaries.
Wait, stablecoins? What are those?
Digital currency refers to a range of different, digital-native tokens. You’ve
probably heard of several of them like sol (on Solana), bitcoin and ether (on
Ethereum). The Solana ecosystem also has a number of other tokens built on top
of it.
Some of these tokens that are built on Solana, like USDC or USDT, are linked to
the US dollar. They’re called stablecoins, and being linked to the dollar
allows them to remain stable against fluctuations. That way you don’t
spend 10,000 BTC on a pizza
, only for it to become much more valuable a decade later!
How is this different from traditional digital payment systems, like Venmo or a credit card?
Think of it as a digital version of cash.
The entire digital financial system is built on intermediaries, says Shere.
Payment systems like Venmo insert themselves between consumers and merchants,
adding fees and slowing down the process. Blockchain payments, on the other
hand, simplify that to a singular, one to one interaction.
Digital payments are “all about direct connection with the consumer to settle
the funds instantly and fast,” he says, “and with virtually no cost for the
consumer.”
What is “Solana Pay”?
Solana Pay is a protocol that allows people to pay with tokens by scanning a
simple QR code. Anyone can set it up in their place of business or use it to
create their own payments program!
What do you mean by wallet?
To do anything with digital payments, you need to set up a digital wallet. There
are several great options in the Solana ecosystem
, and they’re easy to set up! Some, like Phantom, already had Solana Pay
integrated.
Okay, so what exactly can you do with payments that use blockchain?
In addition to removing the fees and slowdowns associated with intermediaries,
building a payments structure on the blockchain is really about creating a one
on one connection between you and someone you’re purchasing something from. And
once you think of it that way, the possibilities are endless.
Think about a small coffee shop. You have a card, get a stamp every time you
make your regular order, and after 10 stamps you get a free coffee. 

Now imagine that same idea existed on the blockchain. Not only could you get a
stamp every time you get a coffee at this shop, but every time you buy coffee
made from those beans, anywhere in the world. Or instead of a free coffee, you
get a digital shirt that can be used in games across the metaverse — and send
you updates . Or that after making ten purchases, you get a voting token that
allows you to vote on decisions about the future of the coffee shop.
It’s very early still, but there may even be uses for this that are beyond what
anyone is thinking. That’s what’s so exciting — it’s removing a lot of the crud
that exists now and allowing merchants and customers to have a conversation.
How do I get started?
If you’re a customer, all you have to do is download a wallet and find a store
or merchant that accepts Solana Pay!
If you’re a merchant who wants to start accepting Solana Pay, you’ll need the
help of a developer, but it’s very easy — and free — to set
up. Learn more here." }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :"Solana in 2019: Growth, Development, and the Road to Mainnet

" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Austin FederaSee all newsAustin Federa is head of strategy at the Solana Foundation.The last twelve months have been an incredible time for base-layer innovation on Solana, making the network the only place where the promise of blockchain meets the lightning-quick standards today’s consumers expect. Today, a Solana ecosystem team is pushing the entire ecosystem forward with the launch of tools that make it possible to truly decentralize the web3 stack.Executable NFTs, available in the open beta of new open source wallet Backpack, represent an entirely new way to build applications that are safer, better to use, and in line with the decentralized values blockchain is built on. By combining executable websites and applications that can run locally on a user’s computer with a crypto wallet, xNFTs in Backpack show a promising new type of hybrid web3 application – not quite an application, not quite a website. xNFTs take a radically practical approach to solving two of web3’s main problems today, decentralization and distribution, with profound implications. While smart contracts run on globally distributed and decentralized networks like Solana, nearly everyone who interacts with smart contracts does so through a website. These centralized, web2 interfaces, and the services that run them, often require the project to register a company, open a bank account, obtain a business debit or credit card, register a domain, and a whole host of other actions just to provide users with a graphical user interface. Each step in that process takes time, money, and adds a potential source of risk for the project’s creators. xNFT Collections unlock whole new avenues for program distribution. A game developer can mint their entire game as limited-edition xNFTs. A DeFi protocol can distribute early access to a new front-end based on wallet addresses. A two-factor code can be generated as an NFT, and automatically cycle through. An artist can create beautiful immersive 3d experiences that can’t be copied, and run directly in the wallet. The possibilities are almost limitless. Because they are, at their core, NFTs, xNFTs can bring a new level of interactivity to traditional collections. The first xNFT Collection, Mad Lads, showcases the power of an executable profile picture collection — the pictures themselves act as a chatroom for users which is rendered entirely within the NFT.xNFTs are not some new smart contracting language, a scaling solution, or a core technology that will take years to deploy. They exist today. This is just one of the many ecosystem-wide innovations that have supercharged the Solana protocol and greater community in the last year:Core engineers from Solana Labs and across the ecosystem have built and deployed the world’s first local fee markets, as well implemented a number of upgrades like QUIC to stabilize the network at times of high activity.State compression is a new innovation that uses Merkle trees to radically shrink the cost of storing any type of data on-chain.Compressed NFTs, the first use case of state compression and developed by engineers at Metaplex and Solana Labs, reduced the cost of storing NFTs on Solana by up 26,000x — as proven by Helium’s migration to Solana, which minted nearly a million NFTs for a little more than $100.Jito Labs released a new version of the Solana validator client that as of March 2023 comprised sixteen percent of total stake — making Solana only the second proof of stake blockchain to have more than one validator client.At Breakpoint 2022, Jump gave a demo of Firedancer, a performant validator client that processed .6 million transactions per second in a test environment.The launch of the Solana Mobile Stack and the flagship device Saga created a framework to make it easy for the world’s 5 billion mobile phone users to use blockchain technologies for the first time.Solana, at its core, is an open source project by thousands of builders across the world. It’s the sum of the work by every ecosystem project, student builder, creator, and more. It is up to the Solana community to bring this ecosystem forward, and I’m heartened to see so many projects bubbling up and growing to make everyone stronger.If you are building something that can help the entire community, the Solana Foundation wants to help. You can apply for a grant, convertible grant, or investment, share your knowledge at Breakpoint, make your project open source, or whatever you can think of. The Solana ecosystem is made up of people who create public goods — Armani Ferrante, the creator of xNFTs, got his start on Solana building the Anchor framework.This community is made up of all of you. And if we help each other, we are going to make it." }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana FoundationSee all newsStarting today, the Solana Foundation is leading the charge by making Solana the first major smart-contract blockchain to have its emissions measured in real time. The emissions tracker was developed in collaboration with Trycarbonara, a carbon data platform, and embeds software directly on Solana nodes to provide the most comprehensive and accurate measurement of the blockchain’s footprint to date. This measurement dynamically changes based on the throughput of individual validators, when they’re online and offline and changes in the validator network over time.This data is includes, for the first time:Emissions measurement of RPC nodes via instrumentation of the underlying hardwareEmissions granularity at the server level incorporating geolocation of validator and RPC nodesMarginal (or consequential) emissions based on the incremental emissions impact of new demand as it relates to the overall distribution of grid supply.

Trycarbonara intends to keep developing their platform over time, and we encourage feedback, questions, and requests for additional analyses. The Solana Foundation hopes to set a new standard for measuring emissions in blockchain by publishing this data. We welcome the chance to work with other ecosystem players, both inside and outside the Solana community, who are interested in better measuring their emissions. Since November 2021, the Solana Foundation has regularly commissioned independent third-party assessments of the emissions of the Solana network. The Foundation is committed to making these measurements more accurate and comprehensive over time. Moving forward, the Solana Foundation will track the release of new features that we expect to make the network more energy efficient and to make it easier for the Solana community to make environmentally conscious decisions.On-chain offsets: Several teams are building solutions to bring tokenized carbon and other nature-based credits on chain, and we will support these efforts where possible.Wallet level emissions analysis: The Foundation is investigating ideas to provide emissions data on a user’s personal carbon on-chain footprint, based on their wallet address.Automatic offset purchases: The Foundation is interested in projects that make it possible to be perpetually net-zero by enabling automatic offset purchases at regular intervals.  Information and Computing Technology (ICT) accounts for up to 3.9% of global carbon emissions – more than that of the airline industry. Accurate measurement with realtime carbon data is the first step towards cutting emissions. We hope the Solana Foundation's efforts will inspire other blockchain networks and projects to take similar steps towards measuring their emissions and building a more regenerative on-chain community.

Helium pioneered a wireless network powered by people with almost one million hotspots deployed, and today marks a significant achievement that we believe will only lead to greater advancements. Helium is a decentralized wireless network, the largest LoRaWAN network in the world, providing wireless access via its constellation of hotspots deployed by individuals and enterprises around the world. Helium has coverage in 192 countries and full wireless coverage in Lisbon, Los Angeles, New York City, London, Zurich, Amsterdam, Istanbul, Berlin, and Sydney, among many others. Helium’s community has also been busy during the past year deploying 5G coverage, with more than 8,000 5G radios in the wild. Helium developers previously operated its own layer 1 blockchain, but the community saw more opportunity to scale and thrive on the Solana network (read more about Helium’s upgrade to Solana). Today, that opportunity becomes reality.This is a great day for the communities of both Helium and Solana.Without worrying about the base layer blockchain, Helium’s vision for a decentralized wireless network will be better realized now because they will be more focused, better resourced, and better able to scale.Helium’s upgrade opens up new utilities on Solana, such as new composability, smart contracts, DeFi, NFTs, other decentralized physical infra projects, and more, which weren’t previously possible on Helium’s own layer 1.Helium’s upgrade to Solana is a great example of how decentralized physical infrastructure projects can provide real utility to users and can leverage Solana’s unrivaled speed, near-zero costs, and energy efficiency.  How the upgrade to Solana is happening is also noteworthy. Each hotspot is being minted as an NFT, a remarkable development on Solana that would be cost-prohibitive on any other blockchain thanks to the recent release of state compression. For instance, minting 900k compressed NFTs on Solana costs as little as 0.3 SOL in storage cost and 5 SOL in transaction cost (roughly $122 at the time of publication), versus ~10,800 SOL ($260,000) in transaction costs for an uncompressed equivalent.This chart is based on a snapshot taken on April 5, 2023 and based on a price of SOL at $21.14, MATIC at $1.14, and ETH at $1,909.45. Learn more here.The value of minting an NFT for each hotspot is that the NFT acts as credentials for the hotspot and verifies its authenticity — all without a centralized service needed for verification. Additionally, the hotspot-as-NFT provides data for developers to build programs on top of Helium, and enables Helium Foundation and the Helium community to create token-gated experiences.Decentralized Physical Infrastructure (DePIN) projects built on Solana serve functions in the real world beyond just executing compute. These projects are unique, as the physical location of the infrastructure provides critical value to the network. Today this can only happen on Solana’s network, which is why DePIN projects from Helium to Hivemapper to Render to Onocoy are flourishing on Solana. These are all projects that bring blockchain technology into the real world.The Solana Foundation is proud that the Helium community chose to build its future on Solana. There are several key advantages to Solana serving as the backbone for Helium:Cost-effective connectivity: Community members benefit from the near-zero transaction costs of Solana.Focus: Helium’s community gets to stay laser-focused on their mission to develop “the people’s network”, not manage a layer 1 blockchain.Open-source ethos: Helium is built on open-source technology, and given that Solana has the second largest organic developer community in web3, there is clear overlap between ecosystems.Composable smart contracts in one global state: Helium developers will, for the first time, be able to write smart contracts that govern hotspots, sensors, and other devices on the network. At the same time, Solana developers will be able to pull in real-world data from Helium into their apps. The power of Solana is that it enables other entrepreneurs and innovators to expand the vision of their product and impact. It’s incredible to witness builders show off the advantages of Solana to people who haven’t yet experienced web3. Just last week, Solana Mobile announced the launch of the Saga phone, which makes it easy and secure for people to take care of their digital assets. Helium Mobile was at the launch event, offering Saga owners a month of free access to the Helium network starting in June. This is just the beginning of the Solana community and the Helium community coming together as one. Stay tuned for what comes next.Editor's note, April 19, 2023: This post has been updated to clarify the costs associated with minting and storing compressed NFTs." }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana FoundationSee all newstl;drSeveral services on the network running custom block-forwarding software inadvertently transmitted a huge amount of data, several order of magnitude larger than a normal block  The network's deduplication logic was able to cope with this, but  this block was re-broadcast to the network by block-forwarding services These re-forwarded blocks overwhelmed the deduplication logic of the forwarding services, overwhelming Turbine and significantly degrading finalization Summary: On February 25th 2023 at approximately 05:46:16 UTC, the Solana Mainnet Beta cluster began to experience long block finalization times. During the degraded period, block leaders automatically entered into vote-only mode, a safety state in which leaders opt to omit economic transactions and instead include only votes when creating blocks. Core developers investigating the event identified the cause of degradation to be congestion within the primary block-propagation protocol, known as “Turbine.” Abnormal network traffic saturated the capacity of Turbine and forced a majority of block data to be transmitted over the much slower fallback Block Repair protocol.Validator operators, suspecting a recent upgrade of the validator software to be at fault, attempted a live downgrade of the cluster in hopes of recovering stability to no avail. Eventually, validators concluded that the quickest route to restored cluster performance would be a manual restart with a downgrade to the last known stable validator software version. On February 26th, at approximately 01:28 UTC, block production resumed with normal finalization times and transaction throughput. This restart did not result in any finalized transactions of economic value being rolled back.Continued investigation revealed the origin of the irregular Turbine traffic to be block forwarding services that malfunctioned upon encountering an unexpectedly large block. This large block overwhelmed validator deduplication filters. As a result, the large block’s data was continuously reforwarded between validators. As new blocks were produced, they exacerbated the issue until the protocol was eventually saturated. On its own, Turbine should be resilient to blocks of this size, as there is filtering in place to discard them. However, the block forwarding services sit in front of this logic, reducing its efficacy.Turbine OverviewA brief overview of Solana’s “Turbine” block propagation protocol is warranted before diving into the root cause analysis.When emitting a proposed block to the rest of the cluster, the slot leader first breaks the block into chunks called “shreds” through a process called “shredding.” Shredding entails splitting the block data into MTU[1]-sized “data shreds” and generating “recovery shreds” for each via the Reed-Solomon erasure coding scheme[2]. Recovery shreds are used to reconstruct any data shreds that do not arrive due to missing peers or otherwise faulty links. With shreds in hand, the slot leader then begins broadcasting them to the rest of the cluster.Topologically, Turbine can be thought of as a tree of star networks called “neighborhoods.” That is, for each peer in a neighborhood at a given depth of the tree, another neighborhood exists at the next lower depth. Neighborhoods are a fixed size and the first node is called the “anchor.” An anchor node is responsible for retransmitting each shred it receives to all of its neighbors (peers in the same neighborhood). Each peer additionally retransmits shreds to all peers assigned the same index within their neighborhood for all neighborhoods in the next lowest layer. This hierarchy ensures an upper bound on the amount of work each node must do per shred; as well as a single loop-free path for each shred from the slot leader to each peer.To load-balance, mitigate faulty links, and as a security measure, peers’ positions in the network are deterministically shuffled by stake weight for every shred. The slot leader then broadcasts each shred to its corresponding anchor node in the first layer neighborhood.Root Cause Analysis:The degradation of the network began when a malfunctioning validator broadcast an abnormally large block during its leader slot. Core developers observing the network identified that Turbine was flooded with data, and the Block Repair protocol saw abnormally high traffic. Upon inspection, it was discovered that the large block had been built off a parent slot far in the past. It is most likely that the block's excessive size was due to padding out proof of history with virtual ticks[3], which is required to prove that the leader has observed the interim period of time. This can happen when a validator diverges from consensus due to misconfiguration, or a software bug or hardware fault occurs.Continued investigation revealed that, during the incident, data shreds from the large block were properly filtered, as they include the requisite metadata to allow filtering on the basis of their parent slot being prior to the last finalized slot. However, recovery shreds do not include this parent slot metadata, and thus were not able to be filtered in this manner. This led to the recovery shreds of the large block overwhelming the deduplication logic, and shred-forwarding services present on the network then propagated these shreds back to nodes in the turbine tree. This degenerate behavior by the shred-forwarders created loops between nodes in the Turbine tree and the shred-forwarding services themselves. As a result, the deduplication filters present in the retransmission pipeline, as well as in the shred-forwarding services themselves, became saturated. This allowed for false negatives, causing duplicate shreds to not be discarded, and instead retransmitted in a continuous loop.Looping shreds overwhelmed Turbine, and block propagation fell back to Block Repair, a much slower protocol intended for obtaining shreds that have failed to arrive via Turbine as well as gathering block data during initial validator catch up. These continuously looping shreds degraded block propagation which in turn slowed consensus block finalization.For a time, optimistic block confirmation was able to continue. However, when a validator observes that its most recently voted upon slot is 400[4] or greater slots from the last finalized slot, it enters this safety state where it elects to stop packing user transactions in an effort to allow block finalization to catch up. Eventually the optimistic block height was sufficiently ahead of the finalized block height (colloquially, the Tower Distance), that leaders automatically entered this safety state known as vote-only mode. This keeps the tip of the chain from continuing on indefinitely and providing optimistic confirmation on user transactions that may never make it into finalized blocks. As a result, the event did not result in any finalized transactions of economic value being rolled back.Context Surrounding the Event:Early speculation by the validator community during the event correlated the issues to the upgrade to v1.14.16 as the event occurred shortly after the upgrade reached a super-majority (66%) of stake. However, as evidenced by extensive Testnet trials on v1.13.6 and v1.14.16, large blocks spamming the network in quick succession, alone, have not been a sufficient condition to induce the problems seen on the network during the event. There was indeed a change to Turbine in v1.14.16 which increased the maximum allowed number of recovery shreds in a block in order to reduce the delay between retransmission of shreds batches. This increase to the number of allowed recovery shreds ensures shred batches maintain the equivalent transmission reliability as in v1.13.6, while simultaneously reducing the retransmission delay.However, as mentioned above, Testnet trials spamming the network with large blocks in quick succession have shown shred-forwarding services to be instrumental in inducing the issue. Without these services in place the network is typically resilient to such large blocks. Even blocks exceeding the size of the large block during the event have been unable to instigate replication of the issue when shred-forwarding services are absent.Improvements:Core engineers have determined that the problem was caused by a failure of deduplication logic in shred-forwarding services, intended to break replicated retransmission of shreds. In addition, the deduplication filter in the retransmission pipeline was not originally designed to prevent loops in the Turbine tree. Enhancements to the deduplication logic are now in place to mitigate saturation of this filter in the Solana Labs validator client v1.13.7 and v1.14.17:The deduplication filter has been adjusted to a design that saturates along a logistic curve. This new filter is probabilistic in nature which does not have the same saturation properties as the old filter that employed a deterministic eviction strategy.The deduplication filter capacity has been greatly increased. Allowing for a significantly higher number of unique elements before saturating.The new deduplication filter is parallelizable, allowing efficient eviction of duplicates and is not bottlenecked by ordering constraints on its elements. The old filter had strict ordering guarantees that forced sequential access; this reduced the ability of the protocol to effectively identify duplicates and evict them in an attempt to prevent saturation of the filter.Core engineers are also working with shred-forwarding service providers to improve the resiliency and compatibility of their designs.Furthermore, a patch to the Solana Labs validator client has been applied that will cause a block producer that produces a large block to abort, thus signaling to the node operator to inspect their node and bring it back to a healthy state within the cluster.During investigation, and absent the introducing shred-forwarders on Testnet, core engineers were unable to reproduce the issues seen during the event. As mentioned previously, this included spamming Testnet with blocks in excess of the size seen during the event, and doing so in quick succession. Post reintroduction of shred-forwarding services on Testnet, and with the addition of the improvements in v1.13.7 and v1.14.17 has shown Testnet to be resilient to the network conditions seen during the event.Longer term, the Solana protocol design is moving to replace all UDP based networking protocols in the validator software with QUIC. QUIC allows for programmatically defined dynamic backpressure and peer filtering which protocols built atop it can use to steer behavior and enforce topology. Implementing QUIC in Turbine will allow the protocol to guarantee that shreds ingested by a node in Turbine followed the protocol defined path, thus enforcing topology constraints within Turbine itself.Footnotes:[1] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit[2] https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reed%E2%80%93Solomon_error_correction[3]  Virtual ticks are PoH entries with no attached transactions. Whenever a block is built off of a parent that is not the immediately preceding slot, the leader generates virtual ticks for each missing slot, and transmits them with its block. This allows the other nodes on the network to confirm that the interceding time was observed.[4] Arbitrary choice equivalent to approximately 160 seconds." }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana FoundationSee all newsEverything Bin Chen and Andrew Chau do for their wildly popular Boba Guys cafe chain is about creating an amazing experience for their customers: from their commitment to using premium, real ingredients to providing exceptional customer service.When Bin and Andrew envisioned a better loyalty program for their customers, they knew it would have to provide an amazing experience. They wanted a program that would scale with them – Boba Guys has two dozen locations in San Francisco, Los Angeles and New York but with plans for more – and they knew they wanted it to truly reward their amazing supporters, many of whom have been fans for years.  Today, Boba Guys announced it will build a new next-generation customer loyalty program on Solana (sign-up here to find out more). By collaborating with the Solana Foundation and leveraging the Solana network’s incredible speed, near-zero transaction costs, and its energy efficiency, the cafe chain will be able to offer real-time rewards and perks to customers, making their experience even more personalized and engaging. “Integrating with Solana is a game-changer for us,” Bin says. “We’ve always been focused on creating a memorable experience for our customers, and leveraging Solana’s blockchain technology in our loyalty program allows us to do that in a way that’s never been done before.”Boba Guys has long been a beloved fixture in the California and New York cafe scene, known for its high-quality boba tea, open and fresh retail spaces, and their vertical integration: owning their own tea company (Tea People) and building the first tapioca ball factory in the United States with US Boba Co.Today’s announcement is not just about the future of retail loyalty programs.

It has done so primarily through grants, which support the development of noncommercial public goods on Solana.The Solana Foundation’s objective is to make sure the right projects are getting the right funding at the right time. And while grants have had a significant impact — supporting third-party development of new educational resources for developers, new infrastructure for NFTs, and even alternate validator clients — there is more that can be done to support the greater Solana ecosystem.Today, the Solana Foundation is excited to announce that its capital deployment strategy is expanding to include convertible grants and investments.New methods for supporting the entire ecosystemGrants have been the primary mechanism the Foundation uses to support public goods in the Solana ecosystem. (“Public goods” generally meaning things that make it easier to build and develop on Solana, and things that other developers can re-use in their own projects.) Historically, grant-eligible projects have generally been limited to open source, non-commercial projects. These projects need financial support to get off the ground the most, as they are the least likely to attract external capital. Developer tooling is a perfect example of a type of project that is vital to the health and growth of Solana, but in many cases would be unlikely to exist if not for grant support.The Foundation remains committed to fostering open source development on Solana. However, closed source products can also deliver public goods to the ecosystem. Because of the grants program’s limitations, the Foundation has generally been unable to support great projects that could benefit the community simply because they were planning to turn their product into a profit-making enterprise.  While grants will remain the primary way the Foundation supports the development of the greater community, two new funding methods will greatly expand how the Solana Foundation can help.Convertible grants are grants that will convert to investments only if a project reaches certain milestones, such as raising a priced round or completing certain growth objectives. This will allow projects to build a viable business, with Solana Foundation support, without the restrictions associated with traditional grants. For instance, some good candidates for a convertible grant could be a project that needs support in building a totally novel proof of concept before being able to raise venture funds, or an infrastructure company that operates closed source.Investments are simply investments from the Foundation into a company. This option is more appropriate for for-profit companies building on Solana that have a commercialized product and are actively raising a funding round. These are projects the Foundation believes could either directly or indirectly forward its goals to advance the adoption, utility, decentralization, or security of the Solana network, but may not be public goods. Investing in commercial ventures comes with its own set of challenges and risks. That’s why the Foundation will be taking a thoughtful and deliberate approach, and will only invest in companies that align with its values and demonstrate a commitment to public goods in the Solana ecosystem — and any and all investment returns will be cycled back into the grants program, so that the Foundation can sustainably support builders in the future. This ensures that investments are creating a positive impact on the Solana community and supporting its long-term growth and success.The Foundation’s decision to invest in companies reflects its desire to help expand the diversifying array of funding options in the greater Solana ecosystem, but it should not be seen as an endorsement of a particular project over another building in the space. Look out for updates as the Foundation embarks on this new chapter of its work.How to applyIf you are interested in applying for a convertible grant or investment, please use the application form at solana.org/grants. In the form, you’ll have an option to note that you will or are actively raising investment funds for your project.

But now, it’s about to cost even less to build user-first web3 projects. Introducing state compression, a new way to store data directly on-chain that cuts down on cost by magnitudes of scale.This chart is based on a snapshot taken on April 5, 2023 and based on a price of SOL at $21.14, MATIC at $1.14, and ETH at $1,909.45. See footnote.State compression is already being used by teams across the Solana ecosystem to power large, user-friendly experiences:Dialect, a blockchain-based messaging service, uses state compression for compressed NFTs to cover the minting cost of NFT stickers to thousands of users. Learn more.Crossmint, an NFT and API tooling company, is using state compression to create integrations that power deeper customer loyalty for companies around the world. Learn more.And that’s just the beginning — projects like user-owned wireless network Helium, NFT distributor DRiP, and on-chain publisher Wordcel are using state compression to bring their scalable, user-first experiences to Solana.Although state compression can be used to store any sort of data on-chain, the first use of this innovative technology is compressed NFTs. Compressed NFTs are just like regular NFTs, only drastically cheaper — minting 100 million compressed NFTs costs about ◎50 to store on-chain, compared to ◎1.2mm for their uncompressed counterpart. In fact, because every incremental compressed NFT is solely a modification of an existing tree, the cost of an NFT on Solana is now as little as the cost of a single transaction (◎0.000005)! Learn more about how compressed NFTs work here.A true cross-ecosystem effort — built by developers at Solana Labs and Metaplex, powered by RPC providers and indexers Helius, Triton, and SimpleHash, and with support from Phantom, Solflare, and the Solana Foundation — state compression is a novel technology primitive that takes advantage of Merkle trees. This compression-friendly data structure allows developers to store a small bit of data on-chain and updates directly in the Solana ledger, cutting the data storage cost down dramatically while still using the security and decentralization of Solana’s base layer.State compression makes elegant use of a well-known data structure and brings it to bear at the speed of Solana, once again proving Solana is the best place to build scalable, user-first web3 products. We can’t wait to see what you make.

    1. This estimate assumes an average gas price of 44 Gwei for Ethereum and 77 Gwei for Polygon based on estimates pulled from Etherscan.io and Polygonscan.io on April 5, 2023. As there is no fixed cost for minting NFTs on Ethereum or Polygon as there is for NFT minting on Solana, the calculations were based on 2m gas units for contract deployment and 400k gas units for minting NFTs, based on estimates gathered from multiple NFT projects on those chains, as well as the assumption that there is the ability to mint as many NFTs specified in a single contract.
" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Jon WongSee all newsJon Wong is technical lead on the ecosystem engineering team at the Solana Foundation.After numerous phases of development, adoption, and rollout, compressed NFTs are live on Solana’s mainnet-beta and powering the next wave of novel on-chain product experiences. Compressed NFTs are 2,400-24,000x cheaper than their uncompressed counterparts, while still retaining identical structures. Now minting 100 million NFTs on Solana costs only ◎50!For the developers who want to get started with compressed NFTs, there are five key things to know:Understand Merkle treesInitialize the treeMint an NFTUse an RPC to get the latest dataUse proofs to transfer NFTsUnderstand Merkle treesState compression takes advantage of Merkle trees, a data structure known for its capability to “compress” the verifiability of a tree of data into a “hash,” or “fingerprint,” of the current state of the tree. The Merkle roots are stored on-chain and updates are stored directly in the Solana ledger, meaning anyone can verifiably (and permissionlessly) reconstruct the tree, combining a vast amount of verifiable off-chain storage with a low overall cost of on-chain storage.Engineers at Solana Labs added the capability to concurrently update Merkle trees multiple times in the same block by allowing the fast-forwarding of stale proofs. This capability is unique to Solana. See more in the whitepaper.Initialize the treeThe first thing you need to do is initialize the Merkle tree. There are three parameters to any Merkle tree: 1) Depth (capacity), 2) buffer size (concurrency / latency), and 3) canopy height (composability).Depth is easy — the capacity of a perfectly balanced concurrent Merkle tree is 2^{DEPTH}, and trees can be configured to hold anywhere from eight leaves all the way up to a billion (2^30). In this case, leaves can be NFTs.Buffer size is an approximation of the number of concurrent updates that can happen in the same block. Merkle trees typically have an issue whereby any modification of the tree causes any previously computed proofs to go out-of-date, but with this novel concurrent Merkle tree implementation, stale proofs can be fast-forwarded and still be accepted by the smart contract. A buffer size of 64 means that any given proof will still remain valid for up to 64 updates of the tree, after which it must be recomputed. Buffer size can be anywhere from eight to 2048.Canopy height specifies the portion of the tree that remains on-chain, reducing the amount of proofs that have to be submitted by clients for verification. Given the current transaction size limits on Solana, this is the only feasible way to pass enough proofs to be able to validate the existence of trees with a depth > 20. Canopy height maxes out at 17.Rather than initialize one giant tree to hold everything, I recommend issuing numerous, smaller trees of varying sizes. This reduces write-lock contention on the tree account, as well as provides more opportunities for composability by reducing the number of proofs needed to be submitted for any given modification.Choose a canopy height that maximizes composability — while it costs more in rent, a canopy height that is DEPTH-3 provides a similar interface to existing NFT-related smart contracts that already pass 3 accounts. For example, a tree of depth 20 could have a canopy of 17 so that clients only need to submit three proofs to make any modification to a tree.Mint an NFTTooling for minting compressed NFTs is already live. Bubblegum, the smart contract written by Metaplex that powers compressed NFTs, uses state compression under the hood. Mint, transfer, and replace instructions should be issued against the Bubblegum smart contract. Mints do not require proofs, so anyone can mint compressed NFTs as easily as before.Use an RPC to get the latest dataCompressed NFTs eschew the typical on-chain account approach, and because data related to trees is being issued into the Solana ledger, RPCs are required to make the “read” experience nice and snappy. Helius, SimpleHash, and Triton all have support for compressed NFTs, and 2/3 implement the Metaplex Read API—a uniform interface for retrieving all the information necessary about both compressed and uncompressed NFTs.Use proofs to transfer NFTsBecause of how compressed NFTs are stored, any modifications to those NFTs (such as an ownership change, or an update to the metadata like the collection information) requires a modification of the storage tree itself. In order to do so, one must compute the proofs needed to signify that you know the latest state of the tree, along with the signature of the leaf owner (or delegate).Merkle tree proofs are the set of hashes that can be used to prove that the leaf was in the tree to begin with. RPC nodes can provide this with the `getAssetProof` Read API RPC method. Depending on the canopy height of the tree, one can submit a subset of the proof path and let the on-chain program handle reconciling the rest of it.Submit the proofs along with the modification you want to make (a new owner!) and send the transaction. Voila!Once you’ve understood these concepts, you should be ready to take advantage of compressed NFTs and build brand new experiences.Here are some additional resources for you to explore:Developer docs: State compressionVideo: Minting Compressed NFTsVideo: Transferring Compressed NFTsVideo: Spotlight on Compressed StateExample application: One Million NFTsExample application: Compressed NFT CalculatorExample code: Readme.md on Github" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana FoundationSee all newsCollecting, appreciating, and sharing art is human nature. This is true with digital art, too, as evident when trying to find the perfect emoji or right sticker to send over text message or popular apps like WhatsApp, Telegram, or Signal. Non-fungible token (NFT) technology has extended this behavior to digital collectibles, giving people the chance to collect digital art and express their personalities with friends. A new technology on Solana called state compression is making this inclination up to 2000 times cheaper. Dialect, a blockchain-based mobile messaging tool, is leaning hard into state compression with its interactive messaging functionality. A social messaging app built on Solana, it lets people share their personality with their friends by letting them mint and share stickers directly within the messaging platform.Dialect uses compressed NFTs, a new type of NFT made possible by state compression, to dramatically lower minting costs and let users share NFT stickers on a mass scale. This solves a massive pain point among NFT enthusiasts by making the already-low cost of NFT minting on Solana almost negligible — which, in turn, makes web3 experiences much more scalable for businesses.Some NFT collectors focus on rarity and scarcity to drive price speculation. But there’s more to be said for the way NFTs can bring together communities and friends, explains Dialect cofounder and CEO Chris Osborn. The company introduced the idea of making chat stickers—a concept already used in popular messaging apps like WhatsApp and Telegram—collectible and ownable, thereby giving users a way to express their unique identities.“[NFT chat stickers are] exactly what you'd expect,” Osborn said. “They are NFTs like any other, but the art is expressive."Such virality will be instrumental in bringing web3 to mainstream adoption, Osborn predicts. This insight isn’t new: At its height in the late 1990s and early 2000s, peer-to-peer chat software AOL Instant Messenger activated 36 million monthly users with custom away messages and stylized fonts. Some technologists even credit AIM for establishing early internet behavior that eventually evolved into social media norms. “What Dialect is building is bringing us one step closer to it being seamless to own digital assets and have them show up in your digital space,” said Solana Foundation technical lead Jon Wong.How compressed NFTs make minting in-app stickers possibleCompressed NFTs rely on a unique innovation from the Solana ecosystem known as state compression. Using a Merkle tree, a commonly known cryptographic structure that branches data into multiple “leaf” nodes connected to a single “root,” state compression stores the minimal amount of data on chain in order to confirm that an NFT’s underlying data is correct, while storing updates in the Solana ledger to take advantage of the chain’s security and decentralization. And with RPC providers and NFT indexers like Helius, Triton, and SimpleHash help with the heavy lifting of managing their own version of the tree, taking advantage of this technology is orders of magnitude easier.Before state compression, messaging apps would have to either 1) bear the full cost of transactions to enable in-platform NFT mints, or 2) transfer those costs to the user. This has disincentivized apps and dApps from attempting to make NFTs available on a massive scale.“When we message on iMessage, WhatsApp or Telegram, we don't pay for those messages, even though [the platform] is paying for infrastructure,” Osborn says. “The same thing goes for NFTs. There's infrastructure costs for provisioning and storing the NFT, and then there's the actual cost of the goods.”Such infrastructure costs are now virtually negligible thanks to compressed NFTs. “What compression technology has done for Dialect is reduced the infrastructure cost to basically nothing. We can do these enormous supply launches, and we don't have to worry about users having to front the bill,” said Osborn.Dialect’s first NFT drop, known as the “genesis” sticker, was free. “Not a single user paid a penny in any way shape or form,” Osborn said, adding that many who minted were first-time web3 users who became onboarded through the NFT minting experience, and no user has paid fees since. “They got to try their first digital collectible at no cost to them. They got to experience true ownership,” says Osborn. “Compression tech makes it possible for us to do these drops at scale to give that ‘try before you buy’ experience that the most sophisticated web2 companies provide.”The cost savings breakdown of compressed NFTsSolana is already known for its cost-effective infrastructure. The normal price of NFT minting on Solana is 0.012 SOL, a comparatively low figure among blockchains.The fee structure in a typical mint increases linearly, meaning the collector pays 0.012 SOL for each NFT they mint. But enterprises that want to issue NFTs to thousands or millions of users must employ technologies that allow NFT mints to get cheaper as volume increases. “If you think about games where the game studio wanted to issue tons of assets as NFTs… it's economically infeasible for the company to handle that,” Osborn says.With state compression, NFT minting costs increase with scale, not linearly. Minting 100,000 NFTs costs $103, and a million NFTs (ten times the original amount) for only $30 more.This chart is based on a snapshot taken on April 5, 2023 and based on a price of SOL at $21.14, MATIC at $1.14, and ETH at $1,909.45. See footnote.NFT stickers for allOsborn says the Dialect team is already observing how gamification emerges naturally through people’s innate desire to create, exchange, share and own cherished artwork in both social and private ways.“Even in a very deep bear market, we've had a lot of excitement around what we're building,” Osborn says. “We have a waitlist, and we've been bringing users into the direct experience as quickly as we can. We're growing every week.”While Dialect is still in beta mode, the company already has thousands of users testing its in-app sticker functionality. The first compressed NFTs were officially released in late 2022, and the team has been able to experiment with gamification and incentivization, noting which features bring users the most delight.“You can trade and open packs, which will be fun, given the randomization,” Osborn says. Meanwhile, artists themselves are excited to recreate the iconic suite of emoji stickers in their signature styles. Already, hundreds of artists have signed up, including Joyce Liu, Hyblinxx, Trev El. Viz, and NFT profile picture projects like Claynosaurz. “Artists can now be like, who's going to be the next great ‘crying with laughter’ sticker that gets brought to adoption?’” GM my lovelies. ✌️Really excited to announce my animated sticker pack with @saydialectIf you’ve collected my work & would like to be apart of my Dialext group chat & have EARLY ACCESS to my sticker pack…Slide into my DMs / or comment below. pic.twitter.com/ovlxZ4vTyS— Trev El. Viz 🛸 (@TrevElViz) March 21, 2023 Osborn predicts the accessibility of decentralized messaging will invite mainstream users to web3, with affordable, mass-minted NFT stickers serving as a type of memento encouraging friends of web3 natives to partake.“A messaging environment, which we think is the best medium for helping onboard more people to crypto, is contextualized,” he says. “It's social. You and your friends can teach each other how to do things. And so we see chat stickers as this entirely new mode of expression for artists and a new kind of collectability for our users and communities.”Wong agrees: “Dialect is really great. The important lens that they're taking is that you shouldn't have to know a lot about tokens or crypto in order to use the product,” he said, adding that the company has been thoughtful about how to make web3 onboarding as simple as sending a message.

" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana FoundationSee all newsNon-fungible tokens (NFTs) can unlock a lot of use cases, from commemorative collectibles to mass-scale ticketing, to the future of customer loyalty. Unique, collectible tokens linked to someone’s digital wallet can supercharge brand fandom by giving fans a new way to take pride in their virtual identities and find belonging in a global community .There’s just one problem: Minting NFTs en masse is expensive. Even on Solana, which has some of the lowest transaction fees of any blockchain, minting NFTs for a loyalty program can be cost prohibitive for mainstream companies.Crossmint, an NFT tooling and API company, is making it easier for enterprise companies to drop NFTs on a massive scale. They use a recent innovation on Solana known as compressed NFTs, which uses state compression to make NFTs cheaper for customers.“The key feature of compressed NFTs is that they make large-scale use cases economically feasible for the first time,” said Crossmint cofounder Rodri Fernández Touza. “When you look at use cases like ticketing, soccer season passes and so on, all of these before were infeasible because you'd have to spend about 40 cents per ticket [to mint the NFT] — and that's too much.”Compressed NFTs are a new class of non-fungible tokens on Solana that employs a technique known as state compression to reduce the load of data storage. State compression uses a Merkle tree structure to store the minimal amount of data on-chain in order to confirm that the underlying data is correct. Meanwhile, updates are stored in the Solana ledger to take advantage of the chain’s security and decentralization, and RPC providers like Triton, Helius, and SimpleHash can help with the heavy lifting of managing the tree. In 2022, the Solana Foundation introduced the concept of compressed NFTs, one of the first use cases for state compression. Instantly, the cost for minting a Solana NFT dropped to roughly $0.000005. By compressing the underlying data, NFT developers can store more information on the blockchain at a lower cost while maintaining the integrity and uniqueness of their respective digital assets. Even better, the cost of minting NFTs gets cheaper at higher volumes, lowering barriers to on a massive scale.Enterprise use cases for compressed NFTs“There's a massive spike in enterprise demand for blockchain infrastructure,” wrote Crossmint co-founder Fernández Touza in a recent LinkedIn post.The blockchain infrastructure provider has already minted roughly 300,000 NFTs for holders of the Crossmint wallet to recognize them for being early adopters. The drop was what Solana Foundation ecosystem technical lead Jon Wong describes as “proof of success,” in that it demonstrated the efficiency of state compression for a straightforward use case. Let’s look at the cost breakdown of Crossmint’s drop. A standard NFT mint on Solana costs about 0.012 SOL, or roughly $0.24 at the time of writing. “Typically, this cost is borne by the minter — not the distributor,” explains Wong. Companies, brands and enterprises that want to reward users need a more efficient solution that doesn’t require asking customers to shoulder the cost, and a company paying $0.24 for each user is far too cost-prohibitive. In Crossmint’s case, delivering NFTs to 300,000 users under normal circumstances would cost over $74,000 (at the time of writing). With state compression, that cost is less than $200.This chart is based on a snapshot taken on April 5, 2023 and based on a price of SOL at $21.14, MATIC at $1.14, and ETH at $1,909.45. See footnote.Mass scale NFTs for customer engagementFernández Touza says it’s now possible to create mass-scale NFTs at a virtually negligible cost. With one successful use case already proven, the Crossmint team is experimenting with new possibilities that before would have been too cost-prohibitive to consider. They’re exploring a few new promising areas with interesting potential for customer engagement. To start, Crossmint is building no-code tools that plug directly into Zapier, an automation platform that connects to over 5,000 apps, including Slack, Mailchimp, Facebook, Saleforce and most social media platforms. This would allow today’s creator or brand to reward customers with digital tokens based on certain actions without code.In another example, one Crossmint client recently created an API for NFT receipts, says Fernández Touza. Imagine buying an item through an ecommerce store and automatically receiving a pass that proves that you purchased it. Whereas now, receipts offer proof of purchase. NFT receipts could signal membership of some kind, or even offer the ability to create smart rewards or loyalty programs through customers’ crypto wallets.NFT receipts are in its beta phase, but Fernández Touza says such developments continue to inspire and inform how Crossmint integrates its no-code tools and products with enterprise platforms across industries. Fernández Touza describes some other ideas to improve customer engagement, even beyond loyalty programs, with compressed NFTs:Social media incentivization. Imagine having the ability to send a new Instagram or Twitter follower an NFT that comes with perks and incentives. “You can talk, engage, track insights and enable access to certain perks only to people following you,”  explains Fernández Touza. A creator or brand could even  upgrade the NFTs of collectors who interact on social media.Gaming, extended reality assets and metaverse experiences. Compressed NFTs can be used to mint in-game assets like skins, characters, items or virtual land. Compression keeps storage and transfer costs under control, allowing the user to stay focused on the important part — playing.On-chain credentials. While some Crossmint clients already do this with uncompressed NFTs, Fernández Touza predicts that online education platforms could soon use compressed NFTs to reward those who complete digital courses with on-chain verified credentials, which could serve as a handy way to stand out in the future job market. Compressed NFTs make building engaging relationships much simpler and scalable — and better for both businesses and their customers.

With respect to metrics including node count, consensus nodes (block-producing validators), Nakamoto coefficient, and node distribution and diversity, the Solana network improved significantly over the past year. It’s made several advancements in resiliency in this period, particularly at the validator client level. Today, Solana is one of the largest proof of stake networks in the world by node count, and one of the most distributed, as measured by Nakamoto Coefficient.Footnotes. Updated March 31, 2023.One of the important measures of validator health isn’t a number, but how the validator network performs in a crisis. In one recent example, server provider Hetzner abruptly blocked Solana validators from using its services in November 2022. Over 1000 validators and 20% of active stake went offline in a matter of hours. The network remained fully online and performant during this transition. Within a few days, nearly all the affected validators were back online at different data centers. Within a few weeks, almost all of the deactivated stake was back online.It’s important to note that Solana mainnet experienced a significant performance degradation on February 25. The validator community successfully restarted the network on February 26, 2023. The root cause remains under investigation and more information will be provided when available.The above events, in addition to significant changes in the market in the past year, have led the Solana Foundation to broaden its evaluation of validator network health. This is expounded on below. Evolutions in measuring the health of the validator networkThe Foundation’s opinion on what makes a healthy validator network has evolved over the last six months, shaped both by data on validator network health and the crises that the industry faced last fall.In particular, the Foundation has broadened its efforts on ensuring that the validator network is healthy at the software level. The community of core engineers working on the Solana validator client are working to mitigate the chance that a single line of code in a single software program halts the network. In this vein, the Foundation has focused on supporting a network of core contributing developers from multiple organizations. Some of the efforts to improve health at the software level over the past year include: New Software Clients in Jito and Firedancer: Validators are computers that run the Solana validator client, which is the operating system of the Solana network. A single zero day or bug in a validator client could bring down an entire network if there’s no “backup” software for the network to run on. An important way to hedge against this risk is for validators to be able to choose between multiple software clients. One of the biggest victories for the ecosystem is Solana becoming a multi-client network. Today, sixteen percent of stake runs through the Jito Labs client. Last August, Jump Crypto announced their plan to build Firedancer, an even more performant validator client for the Solana network. Formalization of Core Contributor Policies and Workstreams: Anyone in the world can contribute code to the Solana network. In the past 120 days, 104 core contributors across multiple organizations have committed code to the Solana network Github repo. They come from multiple organizations, including several independent developers. But the process for becoming a core contributor has long been ad-hoc. The Solana Foundation introduced a few new processes to make core contribution more streamlined and accessible, inspired by best practices in open-source networks like Mozilla. These include:Core Developer Community Calls: Sharing information between multiple teams working on different Solana software clients can get messy. That’s why the Solana Foundation has begun hosting monthly core contributor calls, open for anyone to join or watch recordings. Solana Improvement Documents: Some changes on the network require coordination and buy-in from all the teams working on Solana validator clients. To make this process efficient, the Solana Foundation introduced Solana Improvement Documents (SIMD). SIMD are proposed design documents for how to make changes to the network that require coordination across multiple core development teams. Anyone can submit a SIMD for the core contributor community to review, and then core contributors across teams can come to a consensus on whether and how to adopt the proposal.Solana Labs Contributor Access Policy: Solana Labs formalized a contributor access policy, so that it’s clear for outside contributors to know how they can go about contributing to the Solana Labs code base. Solana mainnet beta launched in March 2020, three years ago. In that time, the ecosystem has matured substantially. Today, the Solana Foundation is focused on increasing node quality in addition to node quantity, supporting an active and independent core developer community, and ensuring there are multiple software clients for validators to choose from. As we dig into the data below, we’ve included some updated thinking about the importance of the traditional metrics for measuring validator health. The Solana Foundation strives to be rigorous and intellectually honest as we assess the network’s health and opportunities to make it even more resilient, and we encourage the community to share their thoughts here.Total Validator CountBlockchains with more validators tend to be more resilient. When a user executes on a contract on a blockchain, they need to be confident that their transmission will be recorded. Ideally, each transmission on a blockchain is recorded on every validator on that chain, which is why a higher number of validators is important: The more times that a message is recorded, the more confident a user can be that their message is accurately recorded and won’t be tampered with. There are two types of validators on the Solana network:Consensus nodes: Consensus nodes are central to the functioning of the network by providing two essential functions: (1) creating and proposing new blocks to the rest of the network and (2) voting on the validity of new blocks proposed by other nodes on the network.Each block contains many messages that are submitted by various users and applications on the network. Every consensus node independently verifies all new messages in a proposed block before voting on its validity. The more nodes that participate in this consensus process, the more confidence a user or third party has that a change to the network or a transaction was verified by a large population. RPC nodes: Remote Procedure Call (RPC) nodes are an application’s gateway to the Solana infrastructure. RPC node operators can offer API, indexing, or other services to provide a convenient interface for users and applications to the core Solana network. These are often commissioned or run by individual applications and are dedicated to that program’s particular task, rather than maintaining consensus on the blockchain. RPC nodes, like consensus nodes, all independently verify all new blocks and changes to the network. They do not vote.A large number of nodes is critical for the health of the network. There’s no clear number for how many nodes is enough. What’s important is that:Users feel confident that their submission will be recorded, no matter what. This is why it’s important to have a large number of copies of the current state available on many nodes, and that they exist in a broad distribution across the world. Solana’s single global state tracks the latest contents of each account, updated in real time with the latest information. Nodes operate independently of each other. A failure of a single node or set of nodes (say, run by a single entity or in a particular geography) should not impact the functioning of the network. Users can verify the accuracy of submissions by looking at other nodes. If a single node goes down or has an issue recording a message, users can rely on other nodes to verify the accuracy of the blockchain. How Solana is doing:
The Solana mainnet beta network went live in March 2020. Since then, it’s grown into a network of over 3,400 validators, including over 2,400 consensus nodes. 2Last updated 3/6/23.The absolute number of nodes on Solana is quite high relative to other proof of stake blockchains, and the Foundation is increasingly paying attention to node quality – not just node quantity. What makes a “high-quality validator” is subjective, but some examples include uptime, service levels in the case of a user issue, or how active the validator operator is in the broader validator community. The Foundation is exploring how it can encourage even more quality validators and will share these reflections with the community as they roll out. In the next section, we’ll discuss the Solana network’s health in terms of its Nakamoto Coefficient. Nakamoto Coefficient for Stake Distribution/Voting PowerUsers of a blockchain must be confident that any valid message they submit will be included in a block and then confirmed through consensus. If a group of consensus nodes becomes compromised or acts maliciously in a coordinated manner, it can attempt to alter or prevent the network from achieving consensus on new blocks.  The Nakamoto Coefficient is a common way to measure a blockchain’s resilience against such behavior. The Nakamoto Coefficient, a metric first proposed by Balaji Srinivasan, is defined as the minimum number of nodes that would need to be compromised to alter or stop consensus in a network, thereby preventing some or all new blocks (and therefore the transactions within them) from being confirmed. This process is known as censorship, and could impact the entire network or some subset of users or applications. In proof of stake networks, the Nakamoto Coefficient is the minimum number of nodes required to represent at least 33.4% of voting power. Consider: A business wants to maintain a monopoly over a certain type of app on a chain. If they can strike a deal with validators who represent 33.34% of the stake on a proof-of-stake network, they can stop the entire blockchain from accepting transactions from competitive businesses by refusing to vote on blocks containing the censored transactions. How Solana is doing:
On Solana, the Nakamoto Coefficient is 31. This means the lowest number of validators that would have to collude to censor the network is 31. The Nakamoto Coefficient is unchanged from the last Validator Health Report (August 2022), when it was also 31. Solana’s the Nakamoto Coefficient grew steadily from the chain’s launch in March 2020 through September 2022 and has remained relatively stable since then. The Solana Foundation is evaluating options for encouraging more high-quality validators. We expect that over time, as high-quality validators get rewarded and more validators work to achieve higher performance, the Nakamoto Coefficient will naturally rise since users will be incentivized to stake to a broader pool of validators. We’ve also included the Nakamoto Coefficient of several other proof of stake blockchains, for the sake of benchmarking. FootnotesA set of validators with a cumulative 33% of the network’s stake delegation is known as a superminority.  A compromise of a superminority would impact the blockchain’s real-time ability to guarantee that new blocks be voted on and added to the chain. In the event that a superminority is compromised, the blockchain could recover by excising the affected validators and restarting consensus without them. The Nakamoto Coefficient for stake distribution represents the size of the smallest population of individual validators which comprise a superminority of stake delegations. When stake distribution is highly centralized, a smaller number of validators may represent 33% (superminority) of total stake delegations.  In a more decentralized distribution of stake and consensus power, this set is larger.There are other factors that impact the resilience of the blockchain. An underestimated one is validator client diversity.  Validator Client DiversityOne of the most underappreciated failure points in a blockchain is the validator client software. Validator clients are like an operating system — they’re the software a validator runs to participate in the network.Software is written by humans and is prone to error. Clients might have bugs, or a malicious actor might be able to sneak through a harmful piece of code, or compromise code in software used by the validator client. This is called a supply chain attack. The open source nature of blockchain makes bugs and attacks easier to catch. Another important way is by building additional software clients, so that validators have options of which validator client they use.Validator client diversity is important beyond providing protection from zero day exploitation. If a bug exists in one client, it’s highly unlikely that it exists in other clients. That means that a bug in a single client is much less likely to cause a long network outage, especially if multiple clients are being used at high rates. More validator clients processing more stake may have been useful in preventing or shortening the network’s performance degradation over the weekend of February 25, 2023.We can measure client diversity through 1) the total number of clients available for use on a blockchain, and 2) the percentage of stake being run through each client.How Solana is doing:
Until recently, there was one validator client on Solana, which was originally developed by Solana Labs. In August 2022, Jito Labs released a second validator client to mainnet. This is a fork of Solana Labs code that Jito is independently building and is responsible for maintaining, changing, and deploying. Also in August 2022, Jump Crypto announced plans to build a completely new validator client on Solana. This validator client is being developed from the ground up in C++ and has a theoretical throughput of one million transactions per second (compared to the original Solana Labs client, whose theoretical throughput is 55,000 transactions per second). Jump Crypto demoed an early version of this client, Firedancer, at the Breakpoint conference in November 2022, showing the client processing 1.2 million transactions per second with simulated traffic. While most of the current validator network uses the original Solana Labs client, an increasing percentage of the network is opting to use Jito Labs’ software. We’re monitoring this number closely and hope to see it become more evenly distributed over time, particularly once Firedancer is deployed to mainnet beta. Even a large, highly distributed network with multiple software clients is vulnerable to several exogenous factors that could impact the resilience of a blockchain. We discuss those in the next and final section. DistributionThe Nakamoto Coefficient and client diversity are critical metrics, but don’t capture the human element involved in running a blockchain. One of the least appreciated aspects of validator network health is the role of exogenous factors, such as geopolitics, natural disasters, and corporate interests. That’s why, in this final section, we look at the Solana network’s resilience in the context of a few exogenous factors and why they’re important. Data Center Concentration:Anyone can run a Solana node. Because Solana requires highly performant hardware, validator operators will often rent server space from privately run data centers to run their nodes. This is not unusual; the majority of the computing power on most blockchains is done on privately owned servers in large data centers. The risk of using private data centers to run validators means that the owners of data centers have disproportionate power over the functioning of a blockchain. It’s important that stake on a blockchain is relatively distributed among private companies that rent server space, in order to minimize the risk that a single company can compromise a chain.We saw this risk rear its head in November, when server provider Hetzner blocked Solana nodes. This was the equivalent of a 20% attack on the network and demonstrates why distribution of stake across multiple server providers is so critical. How Solana is doing:
We’ve split out the data below based on the Autonomous System Number (ASNs) of major data centers, based on data that’s publicly available. An Autonomous System (AS) is a network of servers with a single routing number. Different Autonomous Systems are identified by a unique number, known as the ASN. Depending on how the internal networking/routing is configured, a single ASN could span multiple physical locations in different geographies.Source (last updated 2/6/23)Stake on Solana is relatively distributed among ASNs, with no one autonomous system hosting anything close to 33.3% of active stake. At the moment, at least 3 data centers would have to collude to assemble more than 33.3% of stake and halt the network. Geography:A global, resilient blockchain has to continue operating, no matter the events in a given part of the world. Consider:One government carries out an attack on underwater fiber cables that deliver internet, and knocks out internet to an entire region. A dissident facing retribution from a dictatorial regime has to feel confident she can access funds, even if that regime chooses to shut down servers running a chain in-country.A natural disaster disrupts all the nodes in a particular region. Users of a blockchain in any part of the world still need to feel confident that chain will keep running, even when many validators are unexpectedly knocked offlineHow Solana is doing:
Here’s a snapshot of the geographic distribution of the network, organized based on the percentage of stake in each country. Source (last updated 2/5/23)The network is well distributed geographically, with no one country having 33.3% of active stake. Looking to the futureThe Solana Foundation is continuously working to improve the health of the validator network by providing tools and education to our global community of validators and stakers, and by encouraging the community to be thoughtful participants in securing the network. We continue to celebrate growth in the validator community and Nakamoto Coefficient, but our focus has broadened to include less immediately measurable ways to improve the network health. These include:Organizing opportunities for core developer teams to learn from each other and collaborate where possible.Supporting the validator network with new documentation and tools to make it easier to run a successful validator. Hiring a “Head of Staking Ecosystem” to help ensure the Solana Foundation’s staking program effectively supports the Solana validator community, and to serve as an ambassador for the Solana community of stakers, validators, and integrators. We welcome feedback and questions as we engage with the community. Special thanks to data consultant Joseph Burgess, and the teams at Block Logic and Chainflow. Your input in helping make the data in this report as accurate as possible is deeply appreciated. Editor's Note, March 31, 2023: In response to community feedback, the Nakamoto Coefficient for Ethereum was updated to 20 after previously being listed as 1. The Foundation calculated Ethereum's Nakamoto Coefficient using data from Rated to pull the stakeweights of major node operators and Lido to calculate the stakeweights of individual Lido node operators. The Foundation also believes that a real-time halt to the network would require a 50% attack on the Ethereum network (as opposed to 33% on most Proof of Stake networks). With these factors in mind, we've updated the Ethereum Nakamoto Coefficient to 20, which we believe is the minimum number of nodes that would need to be compromised to halt real-time block production on the Ethereum network. The Foundation's original source for Ethereum's Nakamoto Coefficient, Nakaflow, makes two different assumptions in its calculations: 1) It counts all Lido nodes as a single node, and 2) uses the 33% attack threshold, instead of a 50% threshold. We welcome continued community feedback on this calculation and others across the report.

Lee is General Manager of Games, Entertainment and Media at the Solana Foundation.The first wave of blockchain games in 2021 saw enormous interest but ultimately faltered because they were play-to-earn games, which incentivized economic machinations but not quality gaming experiences. The play-and-earn games that followed encouraged similar behaviors – and have also experienced a similar decline. We are headed toward a future of games being built around a better approach. Play-and-own games are ones where players own their data and progression across games, platforms, and publishers.1 Players will be at the center of these games with gameplay prioritized above all else, certainly above ownership of digital items and collections – just as they should be.

To get to this idealized vision, key elements of games infrastructure need to be rebuilt from the ground up with blockchain technology and the player at its core. In order for players to own their data and progression, games infrastructure providers must build with a focus on open-source/interoperable standards that match current game development and games backend standards. 2Play-and-own as a launchpad of innovationWith a new web3-based games infrastructure, innovations can flow more freely as natural extensions of play-and-own. One example: Players that have progressed beyond a specified level could create and contribute intellectual property to the game through User Generated Content such as extensions of the lore (i.e., IP development and licensing on-chain) and even new feature designs. Another: Often undervalued player activities like community engagement can move on-chain and be integrated to the game to reward and/or incentivize positive player contributions like guild creation and player guides. These types of systems would also help both the developers and players when sequels are released. Currently, sequels in games are a relatively poor player experience requiring separate builds that quite often have zero-to-little connection to the prior build and community. Play-and-own enables a better gaming experience by potentially bringing the player’s community engagement and experience into future franchise installments. Some major providers are building elements of this new games infrastructure (such as Epic Online Services’ cross-progression feature), but player ownership is not prioritized. That can only happen with a focus on open-source/interoperable standards.New games backendGames backend online services need to be built on-chain from the start. We see opportunities for several key multiplayer game backend components to be moved on chain in this new era of play-and-own: 


    Games backend components
    Current experience
    Today’s web3 experience
    Future web3 vision

    
    Authentication
    Easy UX for account creation, but lack of connectivity results in walled gardens.
    Difficult UX, but same connectivity issues create walled gardens in marketplaces, communities, etc.
Most ecosystem builders are solving for onboarding UX, but not the connectivity issue.
    Gamer profile SBT as a KYC’d  management layer enabling verifiable player histories and community engagement.

        
    Inventory management
    Centralized with no true player ownership or ability for true price discovery.
    In-game marketplaces driving asset swaps show early positive data points on revenue generation potential.
    Significant UX improvements in price discovery and third party marketplace txs needed to be at par with current games. 
To enable cross-game asset swaps, integration to games’ backends and setting standards are needed.

        
    User data
    Centralized with no player ownership.
    Mostly still centralized in games.
    Players would have complete control over their user data including profile information, game settings, and progression. Owning attribution and progression could be powerful for enabling players to create and contribute to the game/IP itself.

        
    Matchmaking
    Black box algorithms, which are difficult to implement, test, and deploy.

    On-chain analytics. Blockchain games performance marketing in nascent stage with work mostly being done on LTV side, not CAC/CPI side.
    Social graphs on-chain and Paid UA on-chain resulting in a more efficient market and the player also receiving compensation.


Why is this important?Early data from the Solana games ecosystem indicates that in-game asset swaps represent a commercial opportunity that is large enough for current developers of blockchain games to generate revenue and entice the large game companies to enter the space. This is in part because the main business models of blockchain games are largely additive to existing business models. NFT collections, studio/game tokens, and in-game asset swaps do not replace current games business models of IAPs and advertising.That near-term lucrative business model undershoots the much larger opportunity for blockchain games. We are building toward an intermediate future where multiple blockchain games with active player bases begin to trade cross-game, such as a player trading a sword in one game for a sneaker in another. After that becomes a reality, both user data and player progression can become digital assets — the commercial potential grows exponentially. The Digital Asset Decentralized Exchange, or DADex, is a decentralized exchange specialized for in-game assets. Some examples of these of in-game specializations are integrations with games’ infrastructure for better UX in price discovery and significant improvement in cash out payments UX (for example, direct credits to a player’s credit card) compared to current blockchain games. New forms and utilization of ownership are taking place in blockchain games within the Solana games ecosystem. The ability to trade is just the beginning. Utilization for access, augmentation of the item, lending/renting, and ownership are driving players to contribute in ways not seen before in games. Early data indicates that these factors are significantly driving up key performance metrics like monetization and D7/D30 retention.Why is this best built on Solana?The first principle of play-and-own is that players are at the center, with gameplay prioritized above all else. Consumers will ultimately judge blockchain games based on the gameplay. They have rightly come to expect seamless experiences and high quality graphics. Anything less than that and play-and-own games will join the legion of faded play-to-earn games. Solana is designed and built with performance in mind. A blockchain protocol needs to provide sufficiently high speeds and consistently low fees to enable in-game asset swaps at scale. Layer 2 blockchains that use subnet and sharding technology are positioning themselves to be able to keep fees low enough, but still have similar TPS limits as other L1s and will hit bottlenecks as the games scale. There are also significant trade offs with not building this on a global single shared state like Solana. The slow throughput would make the player experience untenable. Since most in-game asset swaps are driven by current game session player progression, once capacity is reached one would have to bifurcate a player base in a single game across subnets/side chains.In the case of Paid UA in blockchain games and eventually Paid UA on-chain, it is still unclear if subnets or shards will have a significant negative effect on organic growth coming from Paid UA. Solana’s global single shared state results in organic growth when Paid UA is executed. Players from games and users of other products on Solana are much more seamlessly onboarded to your game.We are seeing a new wave of blockchain games coming that aren't like earlier games — the player matters and so does the experience. These new games are an advancement from traditional online games we know and love. Players get rewarded for their efforts and can contribute in a meaningful way to the experience and intellectual property. It’s starting now, but there’s more to do on the infrastructure front to create this new reality. This year is an exciting one for the blockchain games industry. See you all at GDC next week!Footnotes1. Some questions may arise on what this could mean for companies that currently utilize centralized data for commercial purposes and if large games platforms and publishers would push back on this vision. My view is that this will not eliminate commercial opportunities with player data but evolve it. Return ↩
2. It is important to note that interoperability of the new games infrastructure should not result in IP, characters, avatars and items from one game playable in another game. The current pulse of market in games is there is limited demand for this from players and would break the immersion/fourth wall of games for not much value add. The current push for this type of interoperability is largely from profile picture NFT projects seeking utility for their collections. Return ↩" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana FoundationSee all newsASICS is a renowned athletic shoe brand that was founded in Japan after World War II with the mission of uplifting youth and promoting an active lifestyle. Since 1949, the company has been finding more ways to inspire young people by pushing the limits of design and technology. In keeping with tradition, ASICS launched the world's first large-scale brand loyalty program built on the Solana blockchain in November 2022. The campaign’s massive success shows that when it comes to creating web3 loyalty programs, the only limit is imagination. “If a brand wants to launch a loyalty program that can scale at day one, can be at the same size of their current loyalty program, and can deliver better utility and better ownership of the assets associated with said program, to me the answer is Solana Pay, and Solana more generally, all day,” said Joe Pace, ASICS' Director of Web3 and Digital Goods. Pace led ASICS’ first foray into web3 in 2021 with the Sunrise Red NFT Collection. The NFTs served as a sort of digital display case, with each piece of artwork celebrating one of the brand’s most legendary past designs. “It gave us a massive learning opportunity,” he said. Pace was glad to get ASICS “ahead of the digital innovation curve” with the release, but wanted the company’s next web3 project to offer users — and the brand — a unique value proposition. As luck would have it, the Solana Foundation’s Head of Business Development Josh Fried had been mulling over exactly such a project. Yes, exactly: When Fried wrote a blog post theorizing that folks could use Solana Pay to create a new kind of loyalty program with just a few lines of code, he happened to use an imaginary running shoe company as an example. He imagined that customers would buy a physical shoe, and receive an on-chain NFT that connects the virtual pair to the real-life one. Pace immediately realized the impact such a model could have for ASICS. “I was like, this is easy, it’s practical, and it actually has implications for our broader business goals,” he said. “It was a breath of fresh air. I can actually go to the leaders of the business and say, ‘This isn't the Sunrise Red Collection. This is something that could truly innovate on our core business.’”A few emails later, a plan emerged: Selling physical ASICS running shoes with Solana Pay, and using the blockchain to pair each unit with an NFT loyalty badge. “The loyalty badge isn’t owned by ASICS, it’s owned by you,” Fried said. “You can sell it, trade it, collect it. That really wasn’t possible before.” Pace was thrilled with the open source nature of the Solana platform, which meant his team could practically drag-and-drop aspects of the loyalty program they dreamed up from existing projects and users who were ready to collaborate. “So much of the tech that makes it possible—you don’t have to build it,” Pace said. “The marketplace exists. You don’t need to hire full stack teams to manage every part of it. The majority of it is outsourced, which I think is so empowering. The limit is what you’re able to come up with and dream up.” Pace also noted that Solana’s extremely low environmental impact made using the chain “a no brainer.” “We at ASICS care a lot about the environment and our impact on it,” Pace said. “Choosing any other blockchain would have been a step in the wrong direction.”ASICS launched two open edition running shoe designs—the UI Collection—on November 4. Sneakers came in a “light mode” or “dark mode” color scheme, accented by Solana-signature purple and teal. Each pair came with a single loyalty badge. When pre-orders closed five days later, they’d sold around 3,000 units, which Pace says is right in line with other ASICS special-edition drops.Asics steps further into web3 with Solana partnership https://t.co/CVKj51y8zh #Marketing #Advertising pic.twitter.com/NzSvXSBnnG— The Drum (@TheDrum) November 5, 2022 As their first loyalty benefit, buyers were entered to win digital twins of their UI Collection trainers to use to join STEPN, the popular NFT-gated, move-to-earn mobile game. With just 1,001 NFTs to go around, holding multiple loyalty badges essentially gave buyers extra raffle tickets. ASICS is also planning future incentives and opportunities for its new web3 audience. “You’re essentially getting a ticket to whatever comes next,” Pace said, though they’re keeping the details a secret for now.  Fried is excited to see other Solana users dream up and launch loyalty programs in web3, where composability makes collaboration between brands easier than ever before. “In the old world, if you wanted to partner with another brand on something that involved accessing each other's communities, you’d have to either combine reward programs somehow or unpack your software stacks or other back end systems. It's a very complicated process,” Fried said. “With web3, everything is composable. ASICS can easily give their community of loyal badge holders access to a new benefit without having to do all that messy integration.” ASICS bundled the shoes and badges for $200 USDC, but $600,000 in revenue over five days wasn’t the only win.“What’s even more exciting for us is that we were able to sell into 62 countries,” Pace said, noting that the launch marked ASICS’ first-ever global preorder and global shoe distribution — made possible by using a fiat-backed stable digital currency on Solana’s universal blockchain. ASICS was thrilled to see a particularly strong showing in Japan, where the company is headquartered, which validated the idea that web3 could appeal to their core customer base. The story of the campaign made waves in the media, reaching more than a billion impressions. Pace notes that the Solana ecosystem is perfect for creating loyalty programs that marry the best high-tech offerings of web3 with simplicity and ease of use for brands and customers alike. “Your general audience, for most brands, is not going to be a hardcore web3 enthusiast,” he said. “If you want people to do things at scale, then it needs to be easy, it needs to be cheap, and it needs to be fast.

Up to the 1.14 release, core engineers were working to fix live problems that were impacting the network’s speed and usability. These issues included invalid gas metering, lack of flow control for transactions, lack of fee markets, spiraling ram, storage and restart overhead.Addressing these issues was prioritized in an attempt to improve the user experience on the network. Following the latest release, core engineers plan to improve the process for software release rollouts by bringing in additional external developers and auditors to test and find exploits, and continuing to support external core engineers - including the Firedancer team building a second validator client.Improve the upgrade processCore engineers will work with validators to improve the software release process. Previous releases followed a certain pattern like the one for 1.14, which was as follows: Mainnet-beta validators run 1.13Testnet validators run 1.14Devnet validators run 1.14Mainnet-beta validators begin running 1.14 on master canary nodes (i.e. test nodes)Validators, RPC operators, as well as teams deploying dApps on the network, provide feedback on 1.14Mainnet-beta validators began a full deployment of 1.14, initiating the upgrade process Despite having mixed nodes running against mainnet-beta, the behavior of the network changes when the supermajority changes versions. Core engineers plan to help improve the process as follows:Before the mainnet-beta upgrade, downgrade testnet to the current mainnet-beta  version and feature-setUpgrade testnet to the release candidate of the new versionObserve how the testnet migration goes in real-timeDowngrade testnet back to current mainnet-beta versionRepeat this process while stress-testing the testnetRelease new version to mainnet-beta validators for upgradeThis would require regenesis of the testnet image during the first downgrade. Part of this simulation should include changing the stake distribution to mirror mainnet-beta.Both status.solana.com and @SolanaStatus, will continue to be used to signal the upgrade sprints and the status.Forming an adversarial team While core engineers previously performed integration testing, an adversarial team has also been formed comprised of nearly 1/3rd of the Solana Labs core engineering team to build additional hooks and instrumentation into the validator code to help find exploits across the underlying protocols and provide hardware to run medium to large clusters for adversarial simulation. Improve the restart processWhile fully automating the process is difficult, different kinds of failures can be solved with simpler procedures in an effort to improve the restart process. Nodes should be automatically discovering the latest optimistically confirmed slot and sharing the ledger with each other if it is missing.Continuing to focus on stability Over the last 12 months, Solana Labs and third party core engineering teams have also been working to improve the network, and will continue to do so with a focus on stability. For example:A second validator client is being built by Jump Crypto’s Firedancer team, focused on increasing the network’s throughput, efficiency and resiliency.Mango DAO developers are focused on the tooling needed to build on Solana.Network communication technology transitioned to QUIC, a more advanced networking protocolLocal fee markets were implementedStake weighted QoS was incorporated to improve the ability to land transactionsJito’s MEV client is providing alternative paths for landing transactionsImprovements to RPC infrastructure to reduce their loadToday, there are more than 2,000 developers building thousands of programs on Solana. These developers were attracted to Solana because it lets them build things they can build nowhere else, but those developers also need a stable and predictable foundation. Core engineers are committed to making these changes so that reliability does not suffer for the sake of innovation and speed. The community’s input and support is invaluable and helps the network get ever closer to a more decentralized future." }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana FoundationSee all newsUnity introduced today a new Asset Store category for verified decentralized technologies in gaming, which includes the Solana SDK for Unity by Magicblock.Solana is at the center of this new era of decentralized gaming.

We are as energized and resolute as ever because it’s clear to us that the principles that define this ecosystem have never been stronger. A wise man once said, “Don’t call it a comeback.” That’s how we all should feel right now. Despite the turbulent market and constant FUD, the recent Electric Capital Developer Report confirmed that builders keep flocking to Solana. With 8% growth year-over-year for full-time developers in the broader crypto community, the developer numbers on Solana are up 83% as of Dec. 2022, from a year earlier. There are now more than 2,000 monthly active developers building on Solana — second in raw numbers only to Ethereum. Nearly all of this is organic community growth. There are now thousands of teams building projects, dApps, and tools that can only be built using Solana’s high throughput and low fees. For us, it’s a vindication.When the Solana whitepaper was published in late 2017, the vision was to build a future based on fair access to finance, freedom, and security. Ten, fifty, and one hundred years from now, we won’t need centralized financial authorities to decide who can do what in society, and blockchain technology will bring more prosperity and freedom to humanity.It’s been less than three years since the Solana mainnet was launched in beta. Much has changed in the world and even more has changed in crypto — we believe these changes are positive ones overall that will lead the entire industry to realize its future vision. We have never felt more optimistic about this future. How “the promise of web3” failed in 2022If web1 was the internet web of individual static websites, and web2 was the internet of the centralized platform company, web3 is the promise of an internet where users are in control, true owners of the platforms and services they use. Blockchain is the truest expression of the web3 vision — a technology that holds up the principles of decentralization, self-sovereignty, fairness and freedom. But events of the last year have betrayed those tenets.2022 saw perhaps the steepest decline ever in the general public's trust in crypto. Much of the decline can be attributed to companies that did not practice the ideals of web3, and the disastrous events that followed are a direct result of their betrayal of the values we hold dear. These centralized companies did not believe in an even financial playing field, self-custody, or even basic decentralization, and their collapse caused a great deal of damage. For many, the whole industry now has a reputation for being unreliable and untrustworthy.While much of the crypto industry has bounced back quickly, that reputational damage has been highly detrimental to those who have been legitimately building in the space for years and now see their names associated with what has really been “crypto-washed traditional finance”, or outright fraud.  This is frustrating because Decentralized Finance is today disrupting existing, antiquated financial models at an incredibly fast pace. In fact, DeFi would have prevented most of these disastrous events from happening in the first place. Decentralization is the heart of web3 — and to truly embrace web3’s promise, it needs to be the uncompromising core of everything a project does. Fully open-sourced code. All activity on-chain. Self-custody. Community-owned. Trustless and permissionless systems that are specifically designed to prevent fraud and counterparty risk and ensure the highest levels of transparency and accountability for all parties involved. Virtually none of the players that melted down in 2022 valued those principles. The ecosystems that do are still alive and building a better future for us all — including Solana. Solana is a decentralized ecosystem — so much so that when a big actor collapses in spectacular fashion, the community remains resilient, picks up the pieces (in some cases, reclaims the tools for the greater community), and keeps working. The Solana community has seized — and will continue to seize — this opportunity to double down on its core tenets in the wake of the storm on the path to mass adoption.A decentralized futureThe concept of antifragility is perfectly embodied by the saying “what doesn’t kill you, makes you stronger.” Web3 is a great example of an antifragile ecosystem because most of the attacks against it (be it by speculators, the media, legacy systems, and bad actors) have the unintuitive effect of strengthening the community, security, decentralization, and popularity of the network. Bear markets also produce a similar effect, despite the market downturn throughout 2022: The Solana network saw a massive increase in the number of validators. More and more people are investing in the network's security. Over 2,000 nodes are running the blockchain, making Solana one of the world’s most decentralized blockchains as measured by the Nakamoto coefficient.The network keeps getting more performant. A series of new upgrades has stabilized and strengthened the Solana network (even in times of market volatility, like November 2022 or the January 2023 Bonk craze). A second validator client created by a third party, Firedancer — which can process 0.6 million transactions per second in a test environment— will make the risk of network outages magnitudes smaller than in the past and could help move the network out of beta. On top of its speed, reliability, and cost-effectiveness, using Solana is also easy and fun.Transactions settle in the blink of an eye and fees are trivial, mimicking how consumers have expected the internet to work since broadband was introduced decades ago. The network has remained true to the central thesis outlined in the whitepaper, of throughput that matches the New York Stock Exchange or other centralized computer networks.We believe that Solana making blockspace abundant and cheap will leapfrog crypto into its full potential — as big of an opportunity as when Ethereum introduced smart contracts to crypto.Before the creation of smart contracts, it was impossible to conceive that crypto mainstays like NFTs and DAOs could even exist. High throughput making blockspace as cheap, easy to use, and decentralized as possible — could represent just as big, if not bigger, of a leap forward. While it’s a cliche to say “we’re early,” it’s only in the last year or so that Solana’s promise has been vindicated. Projects have already started to unlock the power of high throughput: Parcl, a virtual real estate app; Hivemapper, a decentralized map; permissionless payment protocols like Helio and Decaf that avoid the high fees of traditional payment rails; Helium’s decentralized mobile network, which is migrating to Solana; the decentralized ridesharing platform Teleport; the community-run order book OpenBook; Solana Mobile’s web3-first Saga phone; the censorship-resistant publishing platform Wordcel; Pyth’s high-fidelity market data; and many, many more. We believe 2023 will be a year where the Solana community continues to take the reins and continues to build the framework for a decentralized and permissionless economy. As two members of that community, here is our vision for how we can all move together and make that dream a reality. As many users as possible must be educated about self-custody and developers who are building self-custody solutions should be supported. Without self-sovereignty, crypto will never reach its promise.We want to have one billion people in the world self-custody their private keys. This is not easy because there is still a lot of friction preventing non-technical users from holding their own keys. But we are confident that solutions such as Solana Mobile’s seed vault will help break down those barriers.In order to move toward a better, decentralized web, we need to ensure that on-chain transactions are as fast as a centralized database is able to process. This is incredibly important not only because it enables developers to build better user experiences for those who are used to web2 applications, but also because speed is the key to fairness in finance. In the future we are building, a person living in the most remote part of the world should be able to get real-time data at the same moment as a Wall Street broker. Solana can process thousands of transactions per second on its base layer and can afford to spend its efforts on the application layer rather than on scaling solutions such as L2s, zero-knowledge, or sharding. This also gives Solana a leg up on other networks in terms of user experience: a Solana user will only have to interact with the main blockchain and not get lost in sidechains and L2s. Solana is not and will never be a settlement network but instead runs as a single-state machine where the data propagation ensures speed, security, and scalability.Lastly, we believe that on-chain transactions should remain cheap and affordable. The spirit of web3 is about inclusion and the ecosystem should be accessible to everyone across the world. If on-chain transactions are too costly, users will end up choosing centralized solutions that offer competitive rates. Solana has always been among the cheapest blockchains, and it’s paramount to keep it that way.For people who are new to all this, getting started in crypto can be confusing and intimidating. That’s why so many people had their funds on centralized platforms last year rather than holding their own private keys. We are investing a significant portion of our time into making the onboarding of the next wave of users as easy as possible, while still remaining true to the principles of web3.That means you won’t see the Solana Foundation forking over cash to convince established brands to build on the network. (In our experience, if someone is being paid to be there, they will leave the moment the money stops.) Instead, the homespun projects and established experimenters that come to Solana for the innovative technology and the envelope-pushing use cases — like the ones building experiences with web3-native companies like Primitives or building in-house solutions like ASICS’ Solana-inspired UI shoe collection – will be the focus. We welcome them into the decentralized, thriving community.That community is already stepping up. From community-run hackathons like Solana Sandstorm by LamportDAO, spearheaded by the founder of Helius, to conferences like Solana Crossroads by Step Finance, to the decentralize community group Superteam, we’re seeing the community assuming progressively larger and larger roles in the greater Solana ecosystem (and if you’re hosting some sort of Solana event, let us know! We want to help get the word out). This is actually the ultimate goal, and a sign of healthy, organic growth. Solana is more than any one person or entity. It’s a community that will outlive us all. This bear market is a fantastic opportunity for all of us to improve the Solana network and contribute to the broader web3 space, without the noise that comes with over-hyped bull markets. As builders ourselves, our bet will always be on the builders in the Solana community. We are very excited about the years ahead of us — expect much more to come soon!" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Brandon EchterSee all newsConsensus at the speed of light.That’s the north star that Solana co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko said he was following at his “Looking Back, Looking Forward” keynote at Breakpoint 2022 in Lisbon, Portugal. And even today, after the recent industry turmoil, that has not changed.In order to get to consensus at the speed of light and onboard users around the world, Yakovenko outlined the problems and issues he had identified as roadblocks on the way to mass adoption. Here are the core problems the Solana development team and greater Solana community are tackling now — and what’s on the horizon.Today’s initiatives MobileRight now, crypto is chained to the desktop. But, for millions of people around the world, the primary way they interact with the internet is through their mobile devices. There’s just one big problem.“The business models for web3 are not really compatible with how the business models work in the big app stores,” Yakovenko said. “When you buy-to-own video on Amazon Prime, you don't actually own it. You're renting it from Amazon, maybe forever, or maybe whenever Amazon decides not to have that video anymore. So it's not true digital ownership.”Current mobile phones reflect this centralized set up — curated app stores are not friendly to crypto use cases, and dApps that make it through  app store approval processes require users to take extra steps  to connect to a wallet. It creates a lot of friction for the user. “It's a big challenge, not for the network, but for the user experience,” Yakovenko said. “And for developers.”The Solana Mobile Stack, developed by Solana Mobile and coming first on the Android-compatible Saga phone, aims to make mobile more crypto-friendly. The seed vault, for example, uses the secure element built into every phone to store the seed phrase in a way that cannot be read by Android, allowing dApps to seamlessly connect with wallets. And the Solana dApp Store will be a permissionless marketplace for mobile dApps.DVT-1, the first developer devices, started shipping in mid-December. The Solana dApp Store will accept the first applications in January, and Saga devices for the general public will ship in early 2023.Reliability and ResiliencyFrom "Looking Back, Looking Forward" at Breakpoint 2022, Nov. 5th 2022.Early in 2022, Solana ran into a series of bugs that caused the network to halt — and ever since, network reliability has been the main focus of the core Solana engineering team. Several of these bugs were novel, while others were the result of exponentially increasing use of the network.  “We've had a lot of challenges over the last year,” Yakovenko said. “I would say this whole last year has been all about reliability for the Solana engineering team. And a lot of that, I think we've solved.”Network upgrades are already in the process of being rolled out, if not already:QUIC: Solana uses a permissionless UDP-based protocol to process transactions — but under the old design, high transaction volume could overwhelm the network. Redeploying the UDP on top of QUIC, a protocol written by Google, allows for fast asynchronous communication. QUIC is currently live on Mainnet-beta.Stake-weighted QoS: Weighting validator priority by stake, instead of processing transactions regardless of source, “prevents unstaked nodes or low-stake nodes from spamming everyone else,” Yakovenko says. Stake-weighted QoS is already live on Mainnet-beta.Local fee markets: Local fee markets will allow users to pay a little extra to have their transaction processed first. These fee markets are live on Mainnet-beta, with RPC and wallet support coming soon.And while a number of community projects, like Jito and Mango, are working to make the network more reliable, the biggest wholesale upgrade of the network could come from Firedancer, a new validator client developed by Jump.Firedancer is a second validator client, meaning that people could potentially run their validators using one of two entirely different software packages with independent dependencies. It is extremely performant and processes .6 million transactions per second in a test environment (much more than the current network’s average of 4,000, which is still far more than other blockchains can support).Solana would be the only other smart contract network besides Ethereum to have more than one independent validator client — which would be a boon for the network. If a bug happens to take down one of the clients, the network will remain running on the other, increasing Solana’s reliability and resiliency. Programmability“I've always said that Solana is like Linux, and it should be as programmable as Linux,” said Yakovenko. “That means using modern tools like compilers to support a very large set of developer languages.”The Solana community has made some major strides in ensuring the network became more programmable. There is already a Solidity compiler for Solana, solang. Anchor, a framework for building on Solana, has become much easier for developers to use — and the newly released program Seahorse allows people to write Anchor programs using Python. “We went from chewing glass last year to surfing glass,” Yakovenko said.But there’s still some major moves on the horizon. Token-22, a new token standard, will enable the development of new applications, like collecting royalties on transfers and ownership and confidential payments. Token-22 is coming soon.PerformanceThere’s been a number of other upgrades in the works to make Solana a more secure, performant network.In order to make sure the Solana network can transmit information almost instantly around the world, the core engineering team has introduced some turbine optimizations that are deep under the hood. “I think this is probably the coolest piece of technology that we built that nobody knows about,” Yakovenko said.There is also a lot of work being done on runtime optimizations as well. While upgrades to Solana’s Sealevel runtime have made the network even faster at processing transactions, engineers are still making headway on two really big, difficult problems — the transaction scheduler, and then playing those transactions back.“These are those kinds of engineering problems that you can spend a lifetime on,” Yakovenko said. “The solutions are getting better and better, and heuristics are getting much closer to the best possible you can have.”SecurityThe security of the network is paramount to mainstream adoption. Luckily, a number of improvements will be implemented soon to make Solana more secure–for both the network at large and users.And while Solana’s massive increase in the number of validators has made the network more secure and censorship resistant, there are still improvements that are needed before widespread adoption.“If you really imagine these networks taking over the majority of finance — like real finance, trillions of dollars being moved between banks, between Forex, between payments — these networks need to provide guarantees that are much, much stronger than, than what exists today,” Yakovenko said. “How do we scale the set to the point that at a gut level, when you're the Chief Security Officer at Bank of America, you're like, ‘Well, I can trust this thing, because there's so many nodes that the probability of something going wrong is basically zero’?”Yakovenko points to automatic audits as a security feature developed by ecosystem teams like OtterSec and Sec3 that will help developers catch common smart contract and development mistakes. “As much automation as we can build, the more robust that these systems can get.”Meanwhile, consumer-facing products such as the Solana Mobile Stack’s seed vault will make self custody much easier — and more secure— for consumers.Tomorrow’s challengesAnatoly Yakovenko, on stage at Breakpoint with the Solana Foundation's Austin Federa, Nov. 5th, 2022.ProgrammabilityYakovenko has his eye on some major problems that he would like teams in the Solana ecosystem to tackle.“Luckily, we don't have a difficulty bomb — we’re already Proof of Stake — so I think it's downhill from here,” he said. “But there's still a lot of really hard problems left.On the programmability front, there are a number of big ideas that could make Solana even easier. There’s already tooling in place that could help make formal verification a reality, which could help developers get closer to a second implementation for their smart contracts. “My hope is at next year’s Breakpoint, I'll be talking about the smart contracts that are open source, have formally verifiable specs, that auditors can look at the spec and tell you where you're missing an assumption, or an assumption is not possible to prove,” Yakovenko said.Type-rich bitcode, Yakovenko says “was basically science fiction when I was an undergrad 20 years ago.” Built on the work that’s been previously done with Linux, it could potentially remove a lot of the plumbing and boilerplate between Solana programs that currently cannot call functions between each other. “This is really like the difference between full composability in the world computer, and like passing messages between different services. And I want that full composability,” he said. “The kinds of things that developers will build I think will blow everyone's mind. One of the other gnarly problems on Yakovenko’s mind? Network state and dynamic pricing for storage. “What happens when you have like, 5 billion accounts or 10 billion accounts? We've actually done a lot of optimizations over the last year to just scale it with hardware,” he said. “But that still doesn't mean that we know how to price that storage. We don't know what the value of the next account should be next to the validators, and how to make sure that that storage is used effectively.”Network-levelAt the network level, the name of the game is “slimming down Solana.” What does that mean? Yakovenko points to the research around light clients, which allows users who are not running a full validator node to look at a small sampling of data. These light clients could be a way to effectively secure the network and validate that the majority of nodes are correct. For Solana, he half-jokingly calls these diet clients, “because Solana is a big fat protocol. The proofs are much fatter than something on a very, very thin protocol layer.”Another big idea on Yakovenko’s mind — removing the act of block production from running a validator node. “This allows the actual block producers to be a bit stateless and not need the most synchronized state, so they can spend all of their resources on this very gnarly, real time knapsack problem of creating blocks,” he said. “That's a huge reliability improvement, and a pretty significant improvement for latency.” Using bankless leaders would free up validator nodes to verify the network.The other side of that coin is APEX, which would remove the ebb and flow of dealing with web traffic demands from validators by separating out the work of playing and reviewing blocks from picking forks. “Once you pick a fork, you know the execution and you know the result. And if we can accomplish this, that means that you can have actual program execution run a full epoch behind fork choice. That gives you two days worth of transactions to execute at once,” Yakovenko said.All three ideas would make the network more secure and performant.“The mother of all difficult bombs:” Multiple concurrent block producersThis all leads to the big problem that Yakovenko sees as the holy grail, the “mother of all difficult bombs.”If Solana is to create a real-time historical record of events that happen in the world, information needs to be transmitted as fast as possible. Who heard about information first can determine the winners and losers in the world of finance, for example. “If you're the first to recognize an economic opportunity,” Yakovenko said, “you should be the one to get credit for it to be able to take it.”To fight this, you need to reduce latencies in the network. Take a look at this map as an example:From "Looking Back, Looking Forward" at Breakpoint 2022, Nov. 5th 2022.Right now, Monkey King has to send his transactions across the Atlantic, much further than Solana Summer Monkey. And that geographic distance makes a difference — a few milliseconds of latency could determine whether Monkey King makes a transaction first. If there were to be multiple concurrent block producers, however, there now could be multiple places to validate transactions at the same time — reducing latency and giving everyone a much fairer chance.Yakovenko is quick to point out that although it sounds like it, this isn’t actually the same as sharding, which is popular on some other blockchain platforms. “We still have a single state machine, a single unified worldview of what the state is,” he said. “We just have multiple ways to encode that history.”Ultimately, all these updates and proposals will help make decentralized systems as fast, reliable, and secure as their centralized counterparts. “It just takes a bunch of work and some organization,” he said.And by tackling these problems, the Solana community will be closer to that goal than ever." }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana FoundationSee all newsThis is one of a series of case studies produced for the Solana Foundation that showcases individual, independent projects in the Solana ecosystem.

For Sonia Nigam and Amar Shah, it was a catalyst to do something they had wanted to do together for a long time: start a company. That’s when the Northwestern grads began working on a new idea: Empower consumer giving.Today, their company Change provides brands with a set of web3-based software tools for social impact. Change’s APIs and no-code applications enable:Nonprofits to add a “donate with crypto” form to their websiteNFT collections to accept donations on primary or secondary salesConsumers to donate both crypto and fiat at checkout Change has enabled over $1,000,000 in charitable donations to date and allows individuals to donate to more than 200,000 nonprofit and charitable organizations. The organizations they’ve worked with range from snack delivery service SnackMagic to sustainable jewelry line Lokai, empowering individuals to donate to the Make-A-Wish Foundation, the American Cancer Society, and Girls Who Code.Unlike platforms like GoFundMe, blockchain enables donation transparency to be built into the smart contract set-up. Community members will be able to look up the nonprofit’s wallet and see its entire history of donations and also see what happens to the donation after they make it. Because the blockchain posts transactions, it is easy for individuals to check, on their own, how the money flows. Hear the founders of Change discuss their journey to enabling crypto donations.“Folks want to know, what happened to my $10 I gave to this organization?,” says Sonia. Change allows brands to provide that information and tell those stories of impact – letting a brand inform a customer, for example, that their money went to a particular activity at a particular organization. Compared to other donation services, it’s easier for individuals to follow the money as it travels along a chain, potentially through multiple organizations.“Solana in particular has been a really, really powerful ecosystem,” Sonia says. “We’ve seen a lot of incredible creators build communities, built on mission, and execute on that using Change.” The Solana ecosystem also gave them several competitive advantages, as more brands looked for donation services that accepted cryptocurrencies — and more nonprofits were attracted to Solana over other cryptocurrencies because of its lower carbon footprint. Solana’s cost-effectiveness – transactions cost a fraction of a penny – also means that more of the donations end up in the hands of the non-profit.  Reflecting on where Change has been, and where it’s headed, Sonia is excited for a future where nonprofits raise money quickly and cheaply, using blockchain’s unique advantages.“Imagine a world where every single touchpoint in your commerce journey just gave a cent or two to an important cause,” she describes. “It all of a sudden revolutionizes how consistently we’re driving revenue to important nonprofit players — and it allows them to focus less on setting up the next fundraising gala and more on executing the mission they set out to do.”The information contained in this case study, either pertaining to the Solana Foundation (“Foundation”) or otherwise (together, the “Information”), is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, options, futures, or other derivatives related to securities in any jurisdiction, nor should not be relied upon as advice to buy, sell or hold any of the foregoing.

☀️ The network keeps getting betterAfter a series of bugs last spring, the core Solana engineers and greater Solana ecosystem have been singularly focused on improving the network. And by many metrics, their efforts have succeeded. The Solana network is now more stable, decentralized, and faster than ever before.In order to evaluate the progress, the Solana Foundation has been releasing a series of reports analyzing the network and identifying what areas still need improvement. Here’s what they found:Solana network usage averages around 4,000 transactions per second, thousands more than the nearest competitor.Solana is arguably one of the most decentralized Layer-1 blockchains. As of Dec. 21st, Solana has 1,911 independent validators and a Nakamoto coefficient of 30.The average Solana nonvoting transaction uses less energy than three Google searches — far less an Ethereum transaction, even using estimates from after the Merge. The entire Solana network uses less energy per year than a single Bitcoin transaction.The entire Solana network is carbon neutral, thanks to the support of the Solana Foundation.Even during the collapse of FTX, a stress test of the network, Solana performed well under pressure. Average block time, or the time it takes for the network to produce new blocks, is a good proxy for the performance of the network. Even with the high volume of transactions on Nov. 8, average block time was at .61 ms, well below the historical average.The network is set to improve even more with the release of Jump Crypto’s Firedancer, a second validator client. A new validator client, when adopted, means it’s extremely unlikely that any single bug will bring down the Solana network — making it more secure and stable. Firedancer will make Solana the only other blockchain network besides Ethereum to have more than one validator client.
— Solana Breakpoint ☀️ (@SolanaConf) November 6, 2022 
And did we mention that it’s lightning fast? Firedancer will turbocharge transaction times on Solana, taking the network’s respectable TPS from the thousands to the hundreds of thousands, if not millions — Firedancer processed .6 million transactions per second in a recent live demo in a test environment.☀️ Solana is IRL2022 might be the year that the Solana community left the internet and started making its mark in the real world.Solana Spaces, a company dedicated to bringing the Solana community off the internet and into retail spaces, has opened two locations in the last year. The two locations, one in New York City and their flagship Solana Embassy in Miami, showcase projects from the ecosystem and help onboard new users. And with SpacesDAO, their new decentralized approach to franchising, Solana Spaces will be coming to locations literally around the world.

Of course, all the real-life energy culminated in Breakpoint, the annual conference put on by the Solana Foundation. More than 3,800 members of the Solana community gathered in Lisbon — nearly double the number of attendees the previous year — to see thoughtful discussions, dig into the tech, and hear from the ecosystem about what’s coming up next year.What are you most excited about in 2023?Happy Solana Solstice. We can't wait to see what you build.wagmi 💪" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana FoundationSee all newsThis is one of a series of case studies produced for the Solana Foundation that showcases individual, independent projects in the Solana ecosystem. Being featured in a case study does not constitute an endorsement from the Solana Foundation.Brazil has a massive credit problem. Its overall GDP growth is expected to slow this year — undermined by rising inflation, spillover effects from the Russia-Ukraine War, and other financial constraints — and the situation for Brazilian consumers isn’t any better.Brazilians have some of the costliest loans in the world, and on top of that, commercial Brazilian banks don’t issue credit in ways that match demand. A 2021 study found that Brazil’s Central Bank has not properly accounted for the amount of credit card debt held by consumers (to the tune of hundreds of billions of US dollars). Meanwhile, the average interest rate for Brazilians with unpaid credit card balances, Bloomberg recently reported, is astronomical to the point of disbelief: 346 percent.This is the problem co-founders Thomas Bohner, Maxim Piessen, and Chaim Finizola set out to solve with Credix. Credix is a decentralized credit marketplace that links investors with FinTech companies in emerging markets. And their goal is to tackle these credit challenges head-on.Listen to Credix Co-Founder Maxim Piessen on the Brazil Crypto Report Podcast“The idea really started with bringing real-world assets onto the blockchain,” says Thomas. Much institutional investing still occurs through traditional means, like investing in banks who then make loans. But a combination of high interest rates, legacy technology, and a cumbersome regulatory environment often slows the process of actually getting those loans to individuals.Making private credit investments is a potential solution for those investors — they just need to find the companies to dispense their capital. This is where Credix steps in. The platform helps local borrowers get money at attractive interest rates, and it enables investors to access those opportunities through the platform. “We’ve built a marketplace where we’re connecting institutional investors — whether hedge funds, family offices, asset managers, and accredited investors like high net-worth individuals — and we’re giving them the opportunity to invest in FinTech credits,” Thomas says. In essence, these investors are “sourcing a credit facility through Credix.”Brazilian FinTech company Tecredi is one such company working to lend money to consumers. Tecredi uses a mobile app to enable auto loans with zero physical paperwork (everything is online), and it boasts that it has rates rivaling those in the broader market. However, “because it is a non-bank lender,” Thomas explains, Tecredi “cannot lend from its balance sheets, so it has to go to the capital markets to lend capital.” In other words, the company is reliant on larger, outside forces to provide Brazilians with the loans that they need — in the face of a continually growing credit crisis.With Credix, Tecredi can tokenize the company’s existing loan portfolios and borrow against that in USD Coin. This expedites the loan process for Tecredi and the individuals it helps.Read more about the evolution of DeFi CreditSolana, Maxim says, has been a fast and cheap means of scaling this kind of credit access platform. An investor can put $5 million through the Credix system, for example, and see confirmation in a matter of milliseconds rather than minutes. Because the Solana chain separates state and logic — within a programming model where machines transition between states in a logical flow — it’s also easier to code the logic once and then just open new accounts for companies on top of that, Maxim adds. The web3 ecosystem has enabled fast transactions and accelerated scale than more traditional, often technologically outdated investment channels.In Brazil, Credix has helped get over $25 million in loans to small- and medium-sized enterprises and individuals, passing through Brazilian FinTech companies like Tecredi, A55, Divibank, and Adiante. But Thomas, Maxim, and the rest of the team have no intentions of stopping in Brazil. They’ve recently announced plans to open a $150m credit facility in Colombia in 2023. “Credit is a fuel for growth,” Thomas says. “By opening up borders to bring liquidity into countries like Brazil — and by creating more efficiencies through technologies and smart contracts — we’ll be able to bring down the cost of funding for FinTechs, and they will be able to bring down the cost of funding for the consumers and the small- and medium-sized enterprises locally.” He says that’s what decentralized finance should be about: improving the financial wellness of the end consumer.Credix sees a multi-billion opportunity, from potential relationships with some of the largest Brazilian agricultural farms to consumer FinTech giants in India. Last month, Roberto Campos Neto, president of the Central Bank of Brazil, himself said that he believes that credit cards will soon cease to exist given the growth of the open finance system. For now, Credix is growing — and with credit moving into the web3 ecosystem, the team sees the future borders as limitless.The information contained in this case study, either pertaining to the Solana Foundation (“Foundation”) or otherwise (together, the “Information”), is for general informational purposes only and does not constitute an offer to sell or a solicitation of an offer to buy any securities, options, futures, or other derivatives related to securities in any jurisdiction, nor should not be relied upon as advice to buy, sell or hold any of the foregoing.

But measuring this growth can be sometimes difficult. Solana is unique in how users create and process transactions, and tracking activity is very different from many other blockchains out there. Instead of comparing apples to oranges, there’s a number of correct ways to measure users and developers on Solana.UsersBlockchains are open, transparent systems that publicize data about their users, but how do we effectively track users on-chain? The naive way of tracking users would be to assume one address equals one user, however this is susceptible to sybil attacks. To effectively track users on a blockchain, it is important to adopt a more robust approach.Most blockchains use the signer of a transaction to identify a single user, which means that someone had to cryptographically sign to have the transaction processed correctly. In the case of Solana using unique signers we’re likely to include bots and other programmatic activity. This is because with the account structure, multiple accounts that are owned by one human can sign for a transaction. The main drawback of measuring users based on unique signers is that we’re more likely to capture programmatic activity instead of actual users. On Solana, the feePayer is the address that pays for the fees of a transaction. The first address listed in each transaction is the feePayer. This metric is our proxy for the number of non-custodial wallets active in the Solana ecosystem. We say “proxy” since fee payers can refer to a centralized fee payer that pays fees on behalf of users, such as a centralized wallet provider. The feePayer is the current best metric to measure users because it is a measure of dedicated users while not encompassing a lot of the programmatic activity on the network.Source: FlipsideUsing unique feePayers as users on Solana, we can see that users peaked earlier this year at 2.7 million. Since then the monthly users have trailed back down to where we were right before the peak.DevelopersOne of the best metrics to understand how a chain is growing is the total number of developers building on the chain. To track developers on Solana, you need to have an understanding the current libraries developers use. At the Solana Foundation, we use the Github API to track the projects using the following libraries in the Solana ecosystem:

Using the Github queries provided, you will be able to scrape Solana-related repositories based on the libraries used.Once you have the repositories, you can pull data on who committed code on each day. Pulling commits and subsequent committers, you can start to build up a data set that can tell you trends, retention, and more. Before we dig into that data we need to define what it means to be a “developer on Solana”.Solana-related repositories can be multi-chain or even not be entirely focused on Solana. A great example is an open-source multichain wallet. The focus of a multi-chain wallet repository is likely not just Solana, so it might not be accurate to assume that a developer contributing to that repository is a Solana developer. When we count Solana developers, we count developers working on repositories that happen to support Solana separately from developers working on repositories that are solely focused on Solana development.In November, Solana has had:2053 total active developers on projects with a Solana integration, including multi-chain projects1654 of those active developers are working on a project that is only focused on Solana.This total number of developers shows a holistic view of how the developer community has grown around Solana. It’s important to  note that a decent number of these developers may just be trying Solana for the first time, versus being a full-time developer building on Solana. Let’s define the difference as:Full-time developer: Commit on 5 or more days in the past monthOne-time developer: Commit on 1 day in the past monthIn the past month we have seen:1139 one-time developers120 full-time developersWe can see that there is a decent drop off between one-time developers and full-time developers on Solana. This can help determine the retention rate between someone just trying out Solana for the first time and later becoming a Solana developer.While we can measure a lot about the Solana developer ecosystem, it is good to note that we can only measure data that is currently public. We lose a lot of information on the developer ecosystem for Solana because private repositories or organizations on Github cannot be viewed. Open sourcing code can help developers looking to integrate on your project and give a more accurate view of the number of developers working on Solana today.Using knowledge on the libraries and tooling a developer ecosystem uses can help you gather data and evaluate the strengths and weaknesses of the chain. The Solana Foundation is committed to transparency, and updates to this data and methodology will be shared regularly by the Developer Relations team. We welcome feedback or comments on how the data was collected and how things can be improved." }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana LabsSee all newsIn order to strengthen the Solana network in the face of massive user growth and adoption, engineers have been working on a number of upgrades. This page will allow the greater Solana community to see how these upgrades are progressing. Last updated 14 December 2022QUICSTATUS:  🟢 Live on Mainnet-beta.Solana uses a custom raw UDP-based protocol to pass transactions between RPC nodes and the current leader. Since UDP is connectionless and lacks both flow control and receipt acknowledgments, there is no meaningful way to discourage or mitigate abusive behavior. In order to affect control over network traffic, Solana's transaction ingestion protocol is being reimplemented atop QUIC, a protocol built by Google, designed for fast asynchronous communication like UDP, but with sessions and flow control like TCP. Once adopted, there will be additional options available to adapt and optimize data ingestion.QUIC is currently adopted by the majority of validators and RPC operators on Mainnet-beta. In the upcoming 1.13.4 release, QUIC will be the default transaction ingestion protocol over UDP. With 1.13.4, QUIC will be fully adopted.Stake-weighted QoSSTATUS: 🟢 Live on Mainnet-beta.Leader network bandwidth has a fixed capacity. To effectively use it, stake-weighting is needed to end the practice of indiscriminately accepting transactions on a first-come-first-served basis, without regard for source. Given that Solana is a proof of stake network, it is natural to extend the utility of stake-weighting to transaction quality of service. Under this model, for example, a node with 0.5% stake will have the right to transmit at least 0.5% of the packets to the leader, while the rest of the network – and no combination of the remaining stake – will be able to fully wash them out.Stake-weighted QoS was built in parallel with QUIC and enabled before QUIC was adopted on Mainnet-beta.Fee marketsSTATUS: 🟢  Live on Mainnet-beta, with RPC and wallet support coming soon.Follow progress on Github.Once ingested, transactions still compete for modifying shared account data. This contention has been dealt with by a simple first-come-first-served similar to network data ingestions, leaving users no means to express the urgency of their transaction execution. Fee markets provide a way for a user to add an additional fee to their transactions to express urgency in comparison to other transactions modifying the same account. The first step of creating fee markets is implementing priority fees, which offer users the ability to specify an additional fee at their discretion to be collected upon the execution of a transaction and its inclusion in a block. Priority fees are calculated based on the amount of computing resources that a transaction is expected to require. For example, a simple token transfer would require a lower total priority fee than an NFT mint that expresses the same level of urgency.Fee markets are currently being developed to include more functionality on the RPC, higher fees for highly contested accounts, and improvements to block scheduling.Transaction size increaseSTATUS: 🟡 Under development.Transactions on the Solana network are currently limited to a maximum of 1,232 bytes. This limitation restricts that ability for programs to compose with each other as the transaction has a specific amount of data to fit. With the implementation of QUIC, the possibility of increasing transaction size is within reach. Core engineers are currently testing larger transaction sizes. Compact vote stateSTATUS: 🟡 Live on Testnet.Follow the feature on Github.Vote transactions on the network are the most common transactions transmitted across all nodes. A large voting schema both increases the amount of bandwidth used by the network as well as the block size. Lowering the vote state even by a few bytes can lead to substantial improvements on the network, as less data is being transmitted and stored on the nodes.The compact vote state is being tested in a feature, which is currently live on testnet.Resources“QUIC Tech Talk” Twitter Space with Anatoly YakovenkoThread from Solana Labs co-founder Anatoly Yakovenko on fee markets“3 Major Upcoming Upgrades on Solana That Will Improve Network Performance” by Thalita Franklin at Chorus OneReport from 04-30-22 Solana Mainnet Beta OutageReport from 06-01-22 Solana Mainnet Beta Outage“ELI5: QUIC” on r/solana" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Brandon EchterSee all newsGet this update first. Sign up for the Solana Community Update newsletter!The collapse of FTX was a shock to the web3 community, including the Solana ecosystem. Though the relationship between FTX and the Solana community wasn’t particularly notable recently, FTX was involved in the early days of Solana, largely as the primary developer of Serum. “Think of Serum as a stock market without the centralized exchange of NASDAQ and the NYSE,” said Solana developer Brian Long. “Serum served a critical role in the Solana decentralized finance ecosystem.”Because Serum was one of the first order books built using Solana’s high throughput, it played an outsized role in attracting traditional finance to the ecosystem, added Soju, a contributor to Solend Protocol. “[Serum provided] lots of dependencies from various DeFi protocols.”While Serum was technically a DAO, FTX still held the keys to make changes to the code. As the ecosystem watched the collapse unfold in real time, community members were watching Serum like a hawk. “If the program upgrade keys were compromised, they could be used to change the program and possibly steal user funds,” said Long. Max Shreider of Mango, a large Solana DeFi project, noticed the problem and raised the alarm. The community jumped into action. They forked, or copied the code, from a previous version of Serum to create a brand new, community-owned tool called OpenBook. Soon, Soju said, “other members of the Solana community such as Raydium, Jupiter and Triton were assisting the Mango team in rapidly deploying a fork of Serum v3.” Volunteers from across the Solana ecosystem stepped into action to create the new community-owned resource, jumping in to help however they could.It just can’t end like this. Me and a couple of insanely talented developers decided to take matters into our own hands and push for a relaunch: (6)— Mango Max 🅱️🧑‍🌾🥭🦀 (@m_schneider) November 13, 2022 “I ran some ‘cranks’ — an off-chain script used to process matched orders in the order book,” said Long. He also “helped with the legal stuff” and started to raise awareness of the project in the community. “I guess that makes me a cat-herder, crank-turner, and cheerleader.” Soju helped Long spread the word about OpenBook. “Currently, I run the Discord and Twitter, while coordinating with different parties to get minor tasks done.”The initial transition over to OpenBook has been a success — by Nov. 16th, there was more trading on OpenBook than on Serum. What will happen next, however, is still open to question. “Personally, I would like to see Open Book move forward as a community-led project with no profit motivation,” Long says.Soju agrees. “OpenBook can be something that everyone agrees is vital to Solana, and as a public good, does not serve to enrich any one small group of people,” they said. “This can unite the extremely large pool of talented developers in Solana to contribute to OpenBook, for the entire ecosystem.”Learn more about OpenBook.Top Solana NewsSolana Mobile Announces DVT-1, Coming December 15thThey're here.Solana Mobile announced DVT-1, a developer unit program, would be coming starting Dec. 15th.

To advance  this goal, the Foundation has regularly released updates on the state of the network, including the validator health report, the energy use report, the network performance report, and a presentation on the state of the network at Breakpoint 2022. In the wake of FTX’s collapse, many community members have asked about the state of the network and how it’s faring. We’ve answered specific questions related to the network’s exposure to FTX in a previous post.  This post is a snapshot of a few key metrics on the health of the network in the days and weeks surrounding FTX's collapse.OverallDespite dealing with more complex transactions than normal and being under stress, the network continues to perform well. This Dune dashboard showcases various metrics of network performance. Below, we’ve included block time, transactions per second, compute units per block, and daily programs used.Transactions per SecondAverage transactions per second have averaged over 2,000 TPS since Nov. 8. Additionally, bump fees paid increased throughput over the past week, indicating that prioritization fees served their intended purpose during a time of high activity. Average Block TimeBlock time measures how quickly the network adds more “blocks” to the blockchain, giving us another perspective of the network’s throughput. Average time to produce a block increased to .61ms since Nov. 8, but remained below historical average.Compute Units Per BlockSome transactions are more demanding than others. Compute units help us understand how hard validators are working, which isn’t always clear when examining transactions per second. Compute units per block spiked 180% around Nov. 8th. This is likely due to an increase in trading opportunities, fueled by market volatility in response to news about FTX. Screenshot taken from Solana Compass on Nov. 17, 2022 at approx. 22:10 UTC.

Sign up for the Solana Community Update newsletter!The State of the Solana Network 2022More than 3,700 builders came together in Lisbon for Breakpoint, the conference put on by the Solana Foundation. Community members from around the world came to learn, code, and recognize the accomplishments and hard work of the Solana community. The celebration was cut short a few days later, however, when news of FTX’s collapse shocked the web3 community.We’ve published a blog post to foster transparency and answer questions related to the FTX collapse. You can read that post here. The Solana network remains strong and full of committed builders — see for yourself. Anatoly Yakovenko of Solana Labs and Austin Federa of the Solana Foundation gave the Breakpoint audience an overview of the state of the Solana network, showcasing how the ecosystem has grown over the last year. That robustness remains, with builders banding together to help each other in the wake of last week’s events, including notably a community-run fork of Serum.Here’s the facts on Solana over the past year:User activity. As of October 2022, there were 11.5 million active user accounts on Solana, despite the market downturn (at the peak, there were 22.4 million active user accounts).Developers. The number of open source projects on Solana continues to grow, with 20,717 Github developer repositories as of the start of Breakpoint in early November 2022.NFTs. NFTs have exploded on Solana, with more than 21.9 million NFTs minted from 150,000 creators.Games. Over 1,100 gamers came to Solana Foundation Games Day in Lisbon, which took place the day before Breakpoint kicked off. They played dozens of complete (or nearly complete) games in the Solana ecosystem. There are currently 15 games that are live and playable using Solana, and with 37 expected by March 2023.DeFi. Over $150 million was raised by Solana DeFi projects in 2022.DAOs. At Breakpoint 2021, DAO governance did not exist on Solana. In the year since, new tooling has led to a blossoming of DAOs on Solana, leading to 7,693 DAO proposals and 31,793 total votes.Mobile. Unlocking web3 for mobile devices continues apace.

The shoes came with a NFT digital version matching the physical shoes, as well as a loyalty badge for future exclusive experiences. That future is now.ASICS introduced today a custom running shoe in two forms, each accented with Solana colors, for the global Solana community, dubbed the UI Collection. The shoes are only available to purchase with USDC via Solana Pay at ui.asics.com, and only available for pre-order starting now through Breakpoint and concluding on Nov. 9 at 6:59 AM UTC. The shoes come with a loyalty ASICS Badge NFT, with an initial reward airdrop of a limited number of ASICS-STEPN GT-2000 NFTs (coming soon!). That ASICS is taking this step forward (pun intended) is not a surprise. ASICS sees the potential of a digital dollar currency, such as USDC on Solana, that can break down geographic barriers to facilitate transactions around the world. ASICS sees how customers and brands can come together around token-gated experiences that provide ongoing benefits to both sides. And ASICS is able to bridge the physical and digital with innovative, performance-driven running shoes and an NFT loyalty badge that aligns with their brand values. And why did ASICS choose Solana? That’s easy. First, the Solana ecosystem represents a big population of builders and believers who have shown a willingness to run toward (pun intended #2) unique web3 implementations. Second, because Solana Pay, as a decentralized payments protocol built on the Solana network, enables a consumer to easily send digital dollar currencies directly from their wallet and ASICS receives the funds immediately, with costs measured in fractions of a penny. Finally, ASICS wants Web3 to inspire as many people as possible to create healthy habits with their products, and Solana’s industry-leading speed, low fees, and sustainability make it the obvious choice for scalability and the best user experience.Solana Pay’s impact on commerce can be seismic. We’ve seen Solana Pay incorporated into existing point of sale systems to enable physical checkout, cafes have incorporated Solana Pay so that they can provide customers with loyalty NFTs good for future discounts, and we’ve seen direct-to-consumer ecommerce shops develop entire new checkout flows using Solana Pay that save customers (and the merchant) money. But there's so much more that can be done with web3 commerce, and ASICS is moving the industry forward. Of note: This is the first example of a global brand conducting a global launch of a physical product available only with a digital dollar currency. We expect this is only the beginning, but we applaud ASICS for crossing this finish line (pun intended #3) before anyone else. The limited time pre-order window ensures minimal waste in the production process – ASICS won’t make more shoes than they sell. This environmental benefit is something we at Solana Labs love to see – this also seems like a good time to mention the Solana network is incredibly energy efficient. The two shoe models feature Solana’s color gradient, with Light Mode and Dark Mode inspired by the user interfaces on computer and phone screens. The shoes are available for pre-order now here, and only until Nov. 9 at 6:59 AM UTC.If you want to see what they’ll look like IRL, Solana Spaces in Hudson Yards in NY, the new Solana Embassy in Wynwood in Miami, and the Solana Spaces pop-up at Breakpoint all have the shoes on display. Take a break from that screen you’re reading this on, and run over here (final pun, promise!) for a peek at the future of commerce." }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana FoundationSee all newsSolana is a public, open-source blockchain that anyone in the world can build on and run.The mandate of the Solana Foundation is to support the decentralization, security, resilience, and adoption of the Solana blockchain. The Foundation supports this mission through various programs and initiatives, ranging from creating documentation for validators to issuing grants for projects that further network decentralization. As the Solana network matures and broadens its user base, it’s important that the Solana Foundation and greater web3 community understand the state of the network, where it’s going, and key metrics to track in monitoring its progress. The goal has always been to create a low-cost, accessible, and efficient global state machine. Anyone on the network should be able to access the latest information — its “state”— at the same time as everyone else, and the only barrier to entry should be an internet connection.This is an ambitious goal, and while the network and community of builders have come a long way, there is still work to do. This report, the first of a regular series, is a deep dive into the network’s performance. It’s an opportunity to reflect on how the network has progressed over the past six months, examine where it’s failed, and identify key metrics that provide a holistic perspective on the network’s current performance. This report is part of a broader series of research on the Solana network that includes the validator health report and energy use report. The Solana Foundation welcomes input from the Solana community on this report. Fill out this form with questions, feedback, and metrics that you’d like to see tracked. Network highlights since March 2022Announcement of Firedancer, an alternative open source validator client: In August, Jump Crypto announced their intent to build a new open-source validator implementation for Solana. This would be the second open-source validator client for the Solana blockchain, a major step towards furthering the reliability and throughput of the network.Testnet reaches 24,000 transactions per second: Testnet reached its highest transaction throughput to date on September 22, 2022,  eclipsing 24,000 transactions per second. While testnet load is not an exact copy of Mainnet-beta’s load, it is a leading indicator for Mainnet-beta’s progress. This is a significant step for the performance of the network.QUIC rollout to Mainnet-beta: Solana’s transaction ingestion protocol is being reimplemented on top of QUIC, a protocol built by Google, designed for fast asynchronous communication. This is an improvement on top of the existing UDP-based protocol, which does not have sessions and flow control built in. QUIC is currently live on testnet and mainnet-beta. However, Mainnet-beta still supports both UDP and QUIC. QUIC is planned to be the default transaction ingest and forwarding protocol on Mainnet-beta in the 1.13.4 release.  Once QUIC is adopted, there will be additional options available to optimize data ingestion and discourage abusive behavior. (Learn more in this tech talk by Anatoly Yakovenko on QUIC). Surpassing 2,000 block-producing validators: In August 2022, the network surpassed 2,000 active block-producing validators on mainnet-beta, a notable milestone in the health of the validator network and the evolution of the blockchain. This is one of the largest number of validators for a Proof of Stake network and represents 4x growth in validator count from August 30 2021, when 495 block-producing validators were online.

Network challenges since March 2022The Solana network experienced three outages since March 2022. No user funds were lost in any of these incidents. Below, we review the outages and what is being done to address them. September 2022 Outage: On September 30, Mainnet-beta stopped producing blocks for 6 hours and 19 minutes when the network was unable to recover from a fork caused by a bug in the consensus algorithm implementation. This led to a validator producing duplicate blocks for its leader slots.  The bug was removed and patched. Read the full outage report.June 2022 Outage: On June 1, the Mainnet-beta cluster ceased producing blocks for approximately 4 and a half hours. This was a result of stalled consensus, caused by a bug in the durable nonce transactions feature. Releases v1.9.28/v1.10.23 included an update designed to prevent the network from halting if the same situation were to arise again. Read the full outage report.April 2022 outage: On April 30, Solana’s mainnet beta cluster suffered a 7 hour outage caused by stalled consensus after an enormous amount of inbound transactions (6 million per second) flooded the network. Evidence suggested that bots programmatically tried to win a new NFT being minted. Read the full outage report.Several proposed network upgrades have been implemented or are being rolled out to address the causes of this outage, specifically the implementation of QUIC, fee markets, and stake-weighted Quality of Service (QoS).Upcoming initiatives Solana core developers have been working on a number of new network upgrades aimed at strengthening the network in the face of massive user growth and adoption. Follow the status of these upgrades.QUIC: QUIC is live on most validators and RPC nodes in Mainnet-beta. However, Mainnet-beta still supports both UDP and QUIC for transaction ingest. QUIC is planned to be the default transaction ingest and forwarding protocol on Mainnet-beta starting with the 1.13.4 validator client release. Follow its progress on Github.The Solana network previously used a UDP-based protocol to pass transactions between RPC nodes and the current block leader. UDP lacks flow control and receipt acknowledgments, so it doesn’t provide a meaningful way to discourage or mitigate abusive behavior. To address this, Solana’s transaction ingestion protocol is being implemented on top of QUIC, a protocol that includes sessions and flow control. Stake-weighted Quality-of-Service (QoS): This was built in parallel with QUIC and enabled before QUIC was adopted on Mainet-beta. Follow its progress on Github. Currently, block producers accept transactions without regard for the transaction’s source. Solana is a Proof of Stake network, and stake-weighted QoS extends the utility of stake-weighting to transaction quality. Under this model, a node with .5% stake will have the right to transmit at least .5% of packets to the leader. Transactions submitted by validators that have stake in the network will always be received by the block producer regardless of the amount of traffic coming in from nodes without stake.Fee Markets: Fee markets have been partially introduced and are expected to be further implemented after QUIC is fully adopted. Follow its progress on Github.The first piece of Fee Market implementation is support for Priority Fees. Previously, the network processed transactions on a first-come-first-served basis, which didn’t leave users with any way to express the urgency of a transaction’s execution. Priority Fees change this by offering users the ability to specify an additional fee at their discretion to be collected upon the execution of a transaction and its inclusion in a block. Priority Fees are calculated based on the amount of computing resources that a transaction is expected to require. For example, a simple token transfer would require a lower total Priority Fee than an NFT mint that expresses the same level of urgency. Priority Fees have been live on Mainnet-bteta since July 2022.Future releases will add additional functionality to Fee Markets. These include new RPC methods that will help users and apps determine the minimum additional fee required to be likely included in the next block, higher fees for highly contested accounts, and improvements to block scheduling. These pending improvements are expected to create a more efficient Fee Market for all Solana participants.Overview of network performanceIn order for a billion people to use and take advantage of the benefits of the Solana network, users need to feel confident that they can use the network any time, it will give them accurate information, it will be fast, and that their funds will be safe. Below are a few of the metrics that the Foundation tracks to see how well the network is measuring up to this goal. While a variety of metrics may help illustrate the network’s performance, we highlight four for the sake of simplicity and to allow users to easily track these metrics and how they progress over time. We’ve included these metrics, as well a few others, on a Dune dashboard that makes it easy to dig a layer deeper into the data or run your own analyses. UptimeThe Solana and broader web3 community have raised important questions about the reliability of the network, given outages in the second half of 2021 and first half of 2022. A constantly reliable network is foundational to the trust and continued growth of the network. One of the most important measures of reliability is network uptime. Below, we snapshot the network’s monthly uptime, measured as the percentage of uptime in a given month over the past 6 months. Average monthly uptime

SourceRatio of voting to non-voting transactionsVoting transactions are necessary for the functioning of the network; a vote transaction happens when a validator votes to confirm one or more proposed blocks. Non-voting transactions are the ones triggered by user behavior on the blockchain. For example, a non-voting transaction might represent an NFT mint or a user transferring tokens from one wallet to another. A certain number of voting transactions are required for the network to reach consensus, but over time, we would expect to see the ratio of voting to non-voting transactions go down because the overall percentage of voting transactions should drop as the network gets more efficient. Below is a look at voting to non-voting transactions over time: Block time (time to produce a block)Block time measures the speed of a single transaction, since it measures how quickly the network adds more “blocks” to the blockchain. In this chart, we see the average time to produce a block, how consistent this metric is, and how it changes over time. Average and maximum transactions per secondTotal transactions per second are the most accurate reflection of the current throughput of the network and demonstrate its potential and growth over time. The benchmark throughput is 65,000 transactions per second, based on simple transactions like sending money from one place to another. Actual transactions per second will differ due to the varied mix of complex transactions on the network, and based on demand at any given moment. An NFT purchase, for example, is much more complex than a simple movement of tokens across wallets. The chart below is the best snapshot we have of how well the network is performing in real time. It’s segmented into average transactions per second on a given day, along with maximum transactions per second that the network has ever hit at that point in time. Average transactions per second have been increasing since June.It’s important to note that actual network transactions per second is not a reflection of network capacity, but of demand for transaction throughput. In almost all cases, Mainnet-beta is operating below capacity.  Average transactions per secondMax transactions per secondAs major proposed upgrades are rolled out, the Solana Foundation will update the community on its progress on the upgrades page. The Solana Foundation will continue to monitor the performance of the Solana network and use reports like this one to help the community track its development over time.

    " }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Austin FederaSee all newsAt approximately 22:41 UTC on Friday, Sep. 30, the Solana Mainnet Beta cluster halted when the network was unable to recover from a fork caused by a bug in the consensus algorithm implementation. Block production resumed at approximately 6:57 UTC on Saturday after a coordinated restart, and network operators continued to restore client services over the next several hours.What caused the outage?Due to a validator operator’s malfunctioning hot-spare node, which the operator had deployed as part of a high-availability configuration, duplicate blocks were produced at the same slot height.Both the primary and spare validators became active at the same time, operating with the same node identity, but proposed blocks of differing composition. This situation persisted for at least 24 hours prior to the outage, with most of the validator’s leader slots producing duplicate blocks which were handled safely by the cluster.Initially, duplicate blocks were handled by the network as expected. For example, duplicate blocks were produced in slot 153139220 (220) and the cluster reached consensus on one of those blocks before it continued on to slot 153139221 (221), as should happen for duplicate block conflict resolution.However, at the next slot, 221, duplicate blocks were observed again but an edge case was encountered. Even though the correct version of the block 221 was confirmed, a bug in the fork selection logic prevented block producers from building on top of 221 and prevented the cluster from achieving consensus.Timeline09-30-2022 21:46 UTC: Validators start reporting consensus failure.

This comprehensive initiative includes educational resources for students and professors, a student-focused Discord for learners to connect and ask questions, student developer hackathons, and more.The centerpiece is the Ambassadors Program, which gives the most passionate students at universities or in blockchain clubs a direct line to the Solana Foundation and core Solana Labs engineers. Ambassadors work closely with Solana Foundation staff to build a launch strategy for their school or club and get the educational materials, resources, and speakers it needs. “Blockchain clubs are some of the best ways students learn about web3,” said Dana Dal Bo of the university relations team at the Solana Foundation. “We’re happy to make it easier for students to learn.”Over 300 students from universities from 5 different continents are already actively engaged with Solana U, in addition to an active online community of more than 1000 learning from each other in Discord. Some of the universities whose blockchain clubs have already taken part include the University of Michigan, University of California Berkeley, the University of Belgrade, Yonsei University, and London Business School.Other highlights of the program include:Free workshops, talks, and panels exclusively for students.Accelerators to help jumpstart student projects.University-focused hackathons.The Breakpoint Global Fellows Program, to help students from around the world attend Solana Breakpoint in Lisbon.Student participation in the Solana ecosystem is accelerating. More than 210 projects in the most recent Solana Summer Camp Hackathon – 30% of all submissions – came from students. “Students from all around the world have shown enthusiasm for developing on Solana,” Dal Bo said. “They are consistently coming up with great ideas for new projects and unique approaches for building on Solana. We hope Solana U can serve as a great resource and conduit for even more development and more involvement at the university level.” Interested students, professors, and academics of all stripes are encouraged to apply to Solana U programs:Apply for the Ambassador ProgramApply to join the Solana U student DiscordLearn more about Solana U" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana FoundationSee all newsIn 2021, the Solana Foundation began tracking the carbon footprint of the Solana blockchain and enlisted outside expertise to conduct an independent assessment of the chain’s emissions. Today, the Solana Foundation is releasing the third edition of the energy impact report. The network’s overall emissions rose roughly 26 percent during the past six months driven by overall growth in the validator network and the addition of hardware production (e-waste) emissions in the analysis. The highlights for this report include: 
The assessment of the overall carbon footprint of the network is 3,412 tonne CO2 per year, up 26 percent from 2,707 tonne CO2 per year in March 2022.

The overall carbon footprint is measured by adding emissions due to power consumption (1,772 tonne CO2 per year) and emissions due to hardware production, also known as e-waste (1,639 tonne CO2 per year).


The primary drivers of emissions estimate changes are:

The incorporation of emissions due to hardware production (e-waste) into the energy use report, which added 1,639 tonne CO2 per year.
Decreased emissions as a result of a reduction in the estimated power consumption per validator node, which fell 48 percent from 984W to 509W per validator node.
Improved accuracy due to the inclusion of data center-specific renewable energy utilization, which lowered average network carbon intensity roughly ten percent from 198 to 180 gCO2 per KWh.


All the data and analysis in this report is being uploaded to Github, to further improve its accessibility and so that others can use and build on this dataset.

While there are always improvements to be made when it comes to emissions reduction, it’s important to note that Solana remains an incredibly energy efficient blockchain and that the network is carbon neutral due through the Foundation’s purchase of offsets. This analysis found that running the entire Solana network for an hour uses less energy than a single Bitcoin transaction.

    Many of the updates since the last energy report are driven by steps the Foundation has taken to be more comprehensive and precise in its emissions accounting. Since the outset of the Solana climate report we have erred on the side of overestimating the network’s energy footprint, with the intention to hone the assessment over time as our methodology improves. The updates in this latest energy report are largely reflective of those improvements in methodology. These changes include: Broadening the scope of emissions measured: The report now includes estimates for emissions due to e-waste, incorporating the carbon footprint of the production of validator hardware.Updating validator hardware requirements: Previous reports measured emissions from baseline validator hardware that is more powerful than what is now required to run a Solana node. Accordingly, the estimate of energy consumption per validator node was revised down to 509 W from 984 W in prior reports. Breaking out the carbon footprint of voting vs. non-voting transactions: A key takeaway from previous energy use reports is that a single transaction on Solana uses roughly the energy equivalent of 3 Google searches. Upon further digging into our dataset, we uncovered that a single non-voting transaction on Solana is the energy equivalent of 3 Google searches. However, the average transaction on Solana (including both voting and non-voting transactions) uses the energy equivalent of approximately half a Google search. We will continue to look for opportunities to refine and improve this analysis over time. Additionally, the Foundation is tracking the release of several new features that we expect to make the network more energy efficient. These include:Compressed NFTs: The release of compressed NFTs will make it possible to mint 8 to 10 NFTs in a single transaction, drastically reducing the energy consumption per mint.Doubling of Transaction Size: This will significantly increase the per-block efficiency of the chain and enable the network to accomplish more in a single transaction for a minimal increase in computing power. While this release won’t directly impact emissions per transaction, it will improve throughput of the network and require less computing power to be used for a given set of transactions. Importantly, we invite the community to check our work and to continue to build on these analyses. That’s why the Solana Foundation is publishing the data used to develop the energy use report on Github. Over time, we'll continue to make this data more accessible and useable.This is a novel dataset and analysis was built by Othersphere, an expert firm led by Robert Murphy that the Foundation enlisted to conduct this independent carbon assessment. Data like this is often hard to come by; many emissions-related datasets are only available behind paywalls (if at all). From the outset this analysis was designed to be open and improved by community engagement, and enhancing visibility and access by posting in Github is the latest step in this effort.  It’s our hope at the Foundation that by publishing this data on Github in collaboration with Othersphere, others can build on this work and apply this data set to other use cases. We encourage others to dig into this data and use it as a jumping off point for other analyses, whether specific to the Solana network or to blockchain more broadly.

It’s a question he’s been thinking about a lot these days. At Luda, Sundaram and a team of builders with roots in popular entertainment like Disney, the God of War video game series, and Niantic are trying to reinvent the relationship between fans and stories.Fan communities built around entertainment franchises, like the Marvel Cinematic Universe or Minecraft, are vibrant forces of creativity — that ultimately benefit a large intellectual property rights holder, says Sundaram. “[The fans] don't really have a say in the future of Minecraft or Roblox. They ultimately are customers of that product.”And while NFTs and DAOs can give users ownership over art, many of the current incentives favor price and scarcity, not creative contributions. “Everything we built on the product side is very much about how do you deal with millions of NFTs? How do you make them free to access?” Sundaram says. “There's no mint, there's no auction, there's no drop — it's just you creating something and it's yours if you want it, and creating the model so that people's incentives are not to buy and trade and flip.”To start, Luda has introduced the world of Neo Fairies. Built with a new tool called Wonder Protocol — which allows users to mint as they build unique objects — users will be able to create characters, locations, and more, all while participating in a DAO that will guide the future of the property. And unlike some NFT projects that require a large investment of money up front, all users need to do to join in is make a creative contribution (by responding to a prompt) and pay a few dollars in fees.— Neo Fairies (@neofairies) July 30, 2022 The urban-fantasy Neo Fairies envisions a version of our world where fairies have been in hiding. After joining the Discord, verifying yourself, and answering a prompt to get the creative juices flowing, users get an “Ikur Pass” that allows them to declare an area of the world a “fairy sanctuary” and mint an NFT. Soon, users will be able to use a character builder to create and mint their own characters, rather than receiving a randomly-generated one.“We see this as one of the most aspirational ways to bring people into web3, and this new world that we want to build,” says Sundaram. “What we're trying to do is get this to be something where the community who helped create it, owns it — where the fans and the creators in that universe are literally at the center of that new monster universe in web3-land…. We believe that all entertainment in the future should look and work this way.”Learn more about Neo Fairies.Top Solana NewsJump Crypto introduces new validator client Firedancer— jump_crypto 🔥💃🏻 (@jump_) August 16, 2022 This is big.

We run a range of programs in support of this mission, ranging from creating documentation for validators to issuing grants for projects furthering network decentralization. We also monitor the health and resilience of the Solana network.Our approach to date in commenting on the health of the network has been focused on surfacing data that make it easy for the community to monitor key metrics, like validator count or the length of network outages. As the network continues to mature and broaden its user base, we think it’s important to provide the Solana ecosystem and broader web3 community with more context on how we think about the health of the network.In the coming months, the Solana Foundation will release a series of pieces that touch on various components of network health, including network performance, software, and client updates. We welcome input and engagement from the community on this series. Fill out this form with feedback, questions, and metrics that you’d like to see tracked.In this first report, we’ll dive into the validator network and key metrics we track to assess its health.You can download this report here.Validator Health OverviewThe Solana network is formed by a collection of individuals and entities that choose to run Solana validator software.  Anyone in the world can view, download, modify the validator source code, and run the software to participate in the operation and security of the network.  There is no single entity that controls how the network runs, or what kinds of applications or services can be built or used on top of the network. In this way, Solana is “permissionless”, meaning that nobody needs anyone’s permission to participate, develop, extend or use the network.A growing community of core developers write, test and publish a version of the Solana validator software that is free to use for the community of validator operators.Today, the Solana blockchain consists of over 3,400 validators on six different continents. The long term success of Solana is dependent on a strong, healthy validator network.  A large, diverse set of validator operators are essential to maintain a resilient, distributed and credibly neutral network for the world to use.There are many ways to assess the health of the validator network. Some of the metrics we track include:Total Validator Count: Every validator independently verifies the current state of the blockchain data and any new transactions that are proposed to the network. The total validator count represents the number of separate copies of the current network state that exists on computers all over the world. A high validator count indicates greater guarantees of permanently survivable data storage and network function and recovery, in the event of a catastrophic event or major data loss.Nakamoto Coefficient: This metric, first coined by Balaji Srinivasan, is defined as the minimum number of nodes that must collude or become compromised to stop or selectively alter block production in a network, thereby “censoring” all or part of the network. A high Nakamoto Coefficient is desired to ensure a censorship-resistant network, meaning any user can be ensured that their usage of the network will never be hampered.Distribution: A blockchain with many validators and a high Nakamoto Coefficient is still vulnerable to external factors that can influence the functioning of a blockchain. Here, we look at the role of geography, data center ownership, and entity control over validators to better understand Solana’s resilience in the case of exogenous variables.Total Validator CountBlockchains with more validators tend to be more resilient. When a user performs a transaction on a blockchain, they want to be confident that their transaction will be recorded. Ideally, each transaction on a blockchain is recorded on every validator on that chain, which is why a higher number of validators is important: The more times that a transaction is recorded, the more confident a user can be that their transaction won’t be tampered with.There are two types of validators on the Solana network:Consensus nodes: Consensus nodes are central to the functioning of the network by providing two essential functions: creating and proposing new blocks to the rest of the network, and voting on the validity of new blocks proposed by other nodes on the network.Each block contains many transactions that are submitted by various users and applications on the network. Every consensus node independently verifies all new transactions in a proposed block before voting on its validity. The more nodes that participate in this consensus process, the more confidence a user or third party has that a change to the network or a transaction was verified by a large population. RPC nodes: Remote Procedure Call nodes are an application’s gateway to the Solana infrastructure. RPC node operators can offer API, indexing, or other services to provide a convenient interface for users and applications to the core Solana network. These are often commissioned or run by individual applications and are dedicated to that program’s particular task, rather than maintaining consensus on the blockchain. RPC nodes, like consensus nodes, all independently verify all new blocks and changes to the network.A large number of nodes is critical for the health of the network. There’s no brightline for how many nodes is enough. What’s important is that:Users feel confident that their transaction will be recorded, no matter what. This is why it’s important to have a large number of copies of the current “state” available on many nodes, and that they exist in a broad distribution across the world. The “state” tracks the latest balance of each wallet, updated in real time and always up to date. Nodes operate independently of each other. A failure of a single node or set of nodes (say, run by a single entity or in a particular geography) should not impact the functioning of the network. Users can verify the accuracy of transactions by looking at other nodes. If a single node goes down or has an issue recording a transaction, users can rely on other nodes to verify the accuracy of the blockchain. How Solana is doing: The Solana Mainnet Beta network went live in March 2020. Since then, it’s grown into a network of over 3,400 validators across six continents, including over 1,900 consensus nodes.1 An average of 95 new consensus nodes and 99 RPC nodes have joined the network every month since June 2021.Last updated 7/31/22. In the next section, we’ll discuss the Solana network’s health in terms of its Nakamoto Coefficient. Nakamoto CoefficientUsers of a blockchain must be confident that any valid transaction they submit will be included in a block and then confirmed through consensus. If a group of consensus nodes becomes compromised or acts maliciously in a coordinated manner, it can attempt to alter or prevent the network from achieving consensus on new blocks.  The Nakamoto Coefficient is a common way to measure a blockchain’s resilience against such behavior. The Nakamoto Coefficient is a metric first proposed by Balaji Srinivasan, and is defined as the minimum number of nodes that would need to be compromised to alter or stop consensus in a network, thereby preventing some or all new blocks (and therefore the transactions within them) from being confirmed. This process is known as censorship, and could impact the entire network, or some subset of users or applications. In proof of stake networks, the Nakamoto Coefficient is the minimum number of nodes required to represent at least 33.4% of voting power. Preventing any blockchain from reaching this point is critical for maintaining its usability and keeping it censorship resistant. Consider: A business or state actor wants to maintain a monopoly over a certain type of app on a chain. If they can strike a deal with validators who represent 33.34% of the stake on a blockchain, they can stop the entire blockchain from accepting transactions from competitive businesses by refusing to vote on blocks containing the censored transactions. What Drives Nakamoto Coefficient?On Proof of Stake networks such as Solana, consensus nodes compete with one another to attract stake, which is a mechanism by which people or programs can direct some of their tokens to be associated with a particular validator or validators. Different blockchains implement various incentives or strategies to encourage staking. While the details differ across blockchains, the core principle is the same for most Proof of Stake networks: a validator’s voting “weight” or voting “power” is proportional to the amount of stake associated with it. Therefore, validators which have more stake can have a greater influence on the outcome of the consensus process and block production than validators with less stake. As stake is not evenly distributed across all validators, this results in the existence of a cohort of the most highly staked validators on the network, which collectively represent 33% of the voting power.How Solana is doing:On Solana, the Nakamoto Coefficient is 31. This means the lowest number of validators that would have to collude to censor the network is 31. This number has grown steadily since the chain’s launch in March 2020 and continues to rise, and its growth is a key indicator of the health of the network. We’ve also included the Nakamoto Coefficient of several other Proof of Stake blockchains, for the sake of benchmarking.

The Nakamoto Coefficient is important, but paints an incomplete picture of the resilience of a blockchain. A compromise of the Nakamoto Coefficient would impact the blockchain’s real-time ability to guarantee that new blocks be voted on and added to the chain. In the event that the Nakamoto Coefficient is compromised, the blockchain could recover by excising the affected validators and restarting consensus without them. A successful recovery depends on a large total validator count, which is why the first metric in this report is important. There are also other exogenous factors that impact the resilience of a blockchain. We discuss those in the next and final section. DistributionThe Nakamoto Coefficient is a critical metric, but doesn’t capture the human element involved in running a blockchain. One of the least appreciated aspects of validator network health is the role of exogenous factors, such as geopolitics, natural disasters, and corporate interests. That’s why, in this final section, we look at the Solana network’s resilience in the context of some of these factors, and why they’re important.Geography:A global, resilient blockchain has to continue operating, no matter the events in a given part of the world. Consider:A dissident facing retribution from a dictatorial regime has to feel confident she can access funds, even if that regime chooses to shut down servers running a chain in-country.A natural disaster disrupts all the nodes in a particular region. Users of a blockchain in any part of the world still need to feel confident that chain will keep running, even when many validators are unexpectedly knocked offlineHow Solana is doing:Here’s a snapshot of the geographic distribution of the network, organized based on the percentage of stake in each country. We’ve included the same analysis for Ethereum or the sake of benchmarking, organized by the number of miners across geographies. Source (last updated 8/1/22)Source (last updated 7/22/22)Data Center Concentration:Anyone can run a Solana node. But because Solana requires highly performant hardware, validator operators will often rent server space from privately run data centers to run their nodes. This is not unusual; the majority of the computing power on most blockchains is done on privately owned servers in large data centers. The option to rent privately owned servers has made it significantly easier for anyone to run a validator of any blockchain. However, the risk of using private data centers to run validators means that the owners of data centers have disproportionate power over the functioning of a blockchain. It’s important that stake on a blockchain is relatively distributed among private companies that rent server space, in order to minimize the risk that a single company can compromise a chain.Let’s take Amazon Web Services or Microsoft Azure, for instance. Consider:A large company observes that an app competitive to their service is being built on the Solana blockchain. That company enters into an agreement with AWS or Azure to halt transactions related to that particular app. If Amazon or Azure has sufficient control over the servers running the Solana network, they could agree to this deal and effectively shut the competitive app down.An app on the Solana blockchain emerges that enables dissidents to easily message or send funds to each other. A country could place political pressure on Microsoft or Amazon to halt transactions on that particular app, thereby censoring the blockchain.How Solana is doing:We’ve split out the data below based on the Autonomous System Number (ASNs) of major data centers, based on data that’s publicly available. An Autonomous System (AS) is a network of servers with a single routing number. Different Autonomous Systems are identified by a unique number, known as the ASN.  Depending on how the internal networking/routing is configured, a single ASN could span multiple physical locations in different geographies.Source (last updated 7/22/22)Stake on Solana is relatively distributed among ASNs, with no one autonomous system hosting anything close to 33.3% of active stake. The Solana Foundation continues to monitor this distribution over private data centers and encourages users to continue distributing their stake to a broader set of data centers. Validator ownership across entities: There are over 1,9003 block-producing nodes on the Solana network, but that doesn’t mean that 1,900 separate entities are running each of these nodes. Several companies have built businesses off of running multiple validators on multiple chains. In many ways, this is healthy for blockchains: It means that people have a strong business interest in investing in the security and resilience of a chain. However, it’s critical that no one entity builds up too much control over the validator network of a chain, even if they are running multiple validators. How Solana is doing:The Solana Foundation has verified that of 1,915 consensus-producing validators, at least 1,688 (88.14%) are run by independent entities (updated as of August 1, 2022). The remainder may also be independent of each other, but the Solana Foundation has not verified this. Looking to the futureThe Solana Foundation is continuously working to improve the health of the validator network by providing tools and education to our global community of validators and stakers. In particular, we recognize that continuing to encourage broader distribution of stake across data centers and entities is critical to the health of the validator network. We will continue to monitor this data and report on it regularly.We welcome feedback and questions as we engage with the community.This report is the output of many hours of work from both the Solana Foundation team and several external stakeholders that provided input, edits, and feedback on our methodology.

Please take the steps outlined in the Mitigation section. Starting at 08-02-2022 22:37 UTC and continuing for ~4 hours, a malicious attacker or attackers drained 9,231 wallets of approximately $4.1 million worth of assets. On-chain transaction show that private keys for the affected wallets had been leaked or compromised, and were used to sign malicious transactions. During an investigation by developers, analytics companies, and security auditors, it appears that affected addresses were at one point created, imported, or used in the Slope wallet applications on iOS and Android (created and published by Slope Finance). Private key material from these Slope users was inadvertently transmitted by the Slope app to an application monitoring service, but exactly how the hacker obtained or intercepted this information is still under investigation. No core code related to Solana Labs, the Solana Foundation, or anything related to Solana protocol itself was involved in this attack. This was not a protocol-level vulnerability. This exploit appears isolated to one wallet provider that supports Solana and Ethereum addresses, but affected users on other software wallets (such as Phantom and Solflare) may have been the result of users’ reuse of seed phrases generated or stored within Slope. This is not currently believed to be an issue directly related to any specific wallet implementations other than Slope’s. Any impact to users with Ethereum wallets was likely also due to reuse of seed phrases as both Ethereum and Solana use BIP39 mnemonics.Hardware wallets (used with or without Slope) have not been impacted, and any wallets generated from seed phrases that have never been imported into (or used by) Slope wallets have not been affected. However, all a user had to do to become vulnerable was import their seed phrase into the Slope app. If you believe there is even a chance you did this, please follow mitigation steps below. Block production was not affected by this incident.MitigationSlope Finance is continuing to work with developers, security experts, and protocols throughout the ecosystem – including with top external security and audit groups – to determine the full extent of the issue and how this information was retrieved by the attacker. The Slope Finance team has committed to publicly publishing a full post mortem on this incident (see Slope Finance's statement). Anyone with information pertaining to this breach can reach out to Slope Finance at exploit@slope.group.For any user inquiries or other assistance, please contact support@slope.group.If you are a user of Slope, or have ever previously imported seed phrases into Slope, your wallet may be compromised, even if no assets have been transferred.  Generate a new seed phrase in another wallet application.Transfer all assets (tokens and NFTs) to this new wallet.Abandon the old address, as it was potentially compromised.Users should not reuse any wallets derived from seed phrases previously used with Slope’s mobile applications." }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Brandon EchterSee all newsGet this update first.

But it's been a long time since I was this excited about building something like the Solana Mobile Stack.”He’s right to be excited — Laver is the Mobile Engineering Lead at Solana Labs, which means he’s been working on Solana Mobile Stack (or SMS) in secret for months. And now, it’s time to share what this innovative technology actually does.Laver on stage at the Solana Mobile reveal event, June 24, 2022. Photo by Peter Garritano.To understand the Solana Mobile Stack, you have to understand how difficult it is to use crypto on mobile, Laver says. “When you want to use a dApp, you open up your wallet, you open up that little embedded web browser, you type in the address of the dApp you want to go to, and once you're there, then you can use it kind of like you could on with the wallet adapter on your desktop,” he explains. “But still you're trying to use a dApp that may not have been designed to render well on the mobile web, and then you're trying to use it within a limited purpose web browser within your wallet.”The solution that Laver and the skunkworks team came up with was a series of four innovations meant to streamline web3 on mobile devices. One, the mobile wallet adapter, “​​can bring a really high quality experience that is very much like users have come to expect in terms of ease of use on the desktop, but we can do that on mobile as well.”The Solana Mobile Stack is also built with security in mind. The Seed Vault takes advantage of the deeply-built security element in phones, giving people a key storage option between software custody and a hardware wallet. “We're taking all of the really secure processing — which requires interacting with your private keys — and moving it into this special-purpose environment, which is really built with security in mind,” Laver says.The innovative Solana Pay protocol will also be built into SMS, allowing users to make frictionless payments. “Let's say a merchant were to present a QR code — or even better, an NFC terminal for a tap — users can be assured that when the merchant accepts a loan to pay, they can take their phone and use it just as they would any other payment mechanism,” Laver explains.The fourth innovation will turbocharge adoption — a decentralized dApp store that appears alongside standard app marketplaces. The dApp store is not meant to replace the other apps on a phone, Laver says, but rather be “a place where users can go to find really, really well-focused web3 content that might not be able to be listed in the other app stores.”Anatoly Yakovenko holding Saga, June 24, 2022. Photo by Peter Garritano.With those four innovations, the Solana Mobile team hopes to kickstart a whole new ecosystem and inspire creators to build web3 experiences that weren’t possible before. “I've been doing engineering for a long time now, and I'm constantly amazed by the great new ideas that people are still coming up with whenever presented with a new platform,” he says. “So giving people this new platform to be creative on is what I’m most excited about.”The Solana Mobile Stack SDK is available now — and the Solana Foundation has created a grant fund to support mobile-first projects.

Apply to join the program.See you in Lisbon." }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Anatoly YakovenkoSee all newsI believe that the most powerful thing about crypto is the proliferation of public/private key cryptography for normal, everyday people. For over a decade, the most powerful self-custody experiences in crypto – the ones where users are signing transactions as easily and often as they can send emails – have been stuck on desktop. After all this time, the preferred method of interacting with crypto still involves installing a browser extension and plugging in a thumb drive.In the past two years, Solana has seen rapid growth to millions of active addresses. It’s now the largest platform for NFTs, the most user-friendly onramp to crypto. Through a global community of developers launching thousands of diverse applications across DeFi, collectibles, gaming, payments and more, millions of people are already using private keys to authenticate transactions.But every day, I hear stories of people leaving dinners, conferences, and vacations to get back to their computers and sign important transactions. The mints, trades, listings, and transfers critical to the daily life of crypto-lovers are dragging us away from our lives with others. The only companies with the resources to materialize the self-custody mobile future we’re all dreaming of, Apple and Google, have had no updates to give on their roadmaps for crypto.It’s time for web3 devs to start building for mobile usage instead of around mobile usage. The blockers to achieving this goal are clear: The app store policies of Google and Apple haven’t evolved for web3. The custody solutions on phones haven’t materialized. The software and hardware haven’t been natively integrated. It’s time for crypto to go mobile.It’s time for the secure, biometric-integrated custody solutions we’ve been dreaming of, that have somehow failed to materialize on the roadmaps of the mobile giants. It’s time for an app store governed by users and developers, with no restrictions on tokens or NFTs, allowing for web3-native distribution models that could never be possible in the App Store and Google Play. These features have been technically possible for a while, so there’s no reason to keep waiting.Less than a year ago, the Solana Labs engineering team started to re-imagine web3 for mobile. We started from first principles and focused relentlessly on removing friction for self-custody. We’re now ready to lift the veil.We are introducing today the open source Solana Mobile Stack for Android, enabling native Android web3 apps on Solana (read more here).Solana Mobile Stack includes Seed Vault, a secure custody protocol for mobile that facilitates instant signing of transactions while keeping private keys partitioned from wallets, apps and the Android operating system, along with Mobile Wallet Adapter and integrated payments capabilities.Solana dApp Store, a new app distribution system on Android for decentralized apps.We are revealing Saga, a flagship-quality Android phone shipping with Solana Mobile Stack by Q1 2023, with Seed Vault fully integrated in the trust zone and Secure Element (read more here).We are teasing the Saga Pass, an NFT accompanying the first wave of Saga devices and the first ticket to participating in community governance of the Solana Mobile Stack platform.Any one of these things would be an achievement, but together this is the start of a huge leap forward for crypto adoption on mobile. It’s why we have support from across the entire Solana ecosystem, especially Coral, FTX, Kiyomi/OpenEra, Magic Eden, Okay Bears, Orca, Phantom, StepN, and more. Thank you, one and all.  Solana ecosystem developers have a hunger for constant improvement. Activity on Solana continues to climb, with monthly active fee payers at 2.3 million in June, up 44% from December, and daily programs used on Solana at 1,050 in June, up 169% from December. Attendance at our first 15 hacker houses the past year eclipsed 10,000. The ecosystem of validators and engineers are working hard on performance upgrades (join Discord for more). The opportunity right now is to build features and experiences that take advantage of a smoother ability to do web3 transactions on mobile, to carry digital assets around anywhere (and how that unlocks new use cases), and an ability to tie mobile payments capabilities to web3 payments rails to eliminate intermediaries.I’ve lived and breathed mobile for much of my career. I know how powerful it can be for sparking unexpected use cases and global reach. I participated in the earliest wireless technology that brought the first basic mobile games to cell phones and from that we are well into the 5G which is connecting everyone to everything. I’m more excited about this than anything we’ve done since we launched Solana. Now, just like then, I can’t predict what will be built in the next few years– but I know this is a step we felt like we had to take.Solana Mobile Homepage, including pre-order informationDownload the Solana Mobile Stack SDKSolana Mobile Stack begins new era of web3 with mobile-first Android platformSolana Mobile debuts Saga, a flagship Android phone for web3" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana MobileSee all newsNEW YORK, June 23, 2022 /PRNewswire/ – Solana Mobile, a subsidiary of Solana Labs, debuted today Solana Mobile Stack, an open source software toolkit for Android enabling native Android web3 apps on Solana with the Seed Vault secure custody protocol that facilitates instant signing of transactions while keeping private keys partitioned from wallets, apps and the Android operating system.“Developers have been blocked for too long from creating truly decentralized mobile apps because the existing gatekeeper model just doesn’t work anymore,” said Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana. “We live our lives on our mobile devices – except for web3 because there hasn’t been a mobile-centric approach to private key management. The Solana Mobile Stack shows a new path forward on Solana that is open source, secure, optimized for web3, and easy to use.”The Solana Mobile Stack (SMS) provides a new set of libraries for wallets and apps, allowing developers to create rich mobile experiences on Solana, the world’s most performant blockchain, and is built to run alongside Android. The SDK provides libraries and programming interfaces for Android apps and secure key private storage, simplifying the developer experience to build and extend dApps functionality for Solana. The SDK is available starting today. Solana Mobile Stack was introduced at an event in New York today, which also included the introduction of Saga, a flagship Android mobile phone with unique functionality and features tightly integrated with Solana, and is available now for pre-orders for delivery in early 2023 (read more here). “Developers can now bring the power of Solana to the computers in our pockets, not just our backpacks,” said Raj Gokal, co-founder of Solana. “Solana can revolutionize so much of what we do everyday, but we need to open the possibilities for decentralized apps on our mobile devices in order for this potential to be realized.” Initial features of the Solana Mobile Stack SDK include: Mobile Wallet Adapter: A protocol for connecting web apps and native Android apps to wallets on mobile devices. The open source protocol is designed to support all mobile platforms, not just Android, and can work with wallet apps providing signing services to apps running remotely, such as other mobile devices, and on desktop or laptop computers.Seed Vault: A secure environment built into a mobile device that keeps private keys, seed phrases and secrets separated from the application layer yet still capable of interacting with apps running on the device or in a mobile browser. Seed Vault accesses the highest privileged security environment available on a device, from secure operating modes of the processor to dedicated Secure Elements, which enables a secure transaction signing experience through UI components built into Android. Solana Pay for Android: Solana Pay, a decentralized payments rail on Solana, is built into Solana Mobile Stack, providing wallet apps the ability to use the system features of Android devices to capture Solana Pay URLs via QR codes, NFC taps, messages, and web browser interactions to launch Solana Pay requests. In addition, instant virtual card issuance will allow users to make contactless-based mobile payments backed by their self-custodied funds via traditional payment rails at tens of millions of merchants across the globe. Additionally, Solana dApp Store is a new app distribution system on Android for decentralized apps. The Solana dApp Store will provide a distribution channel for apps that want to establish direct relationships with their customers, allowing them to transact without platform fees. The Solana dApp Store will co-exist with Google Play on devices, providing access to web2 and web3 apps. The Solana Mobile Stack and Solana dApp Store open up unexplored opportunities for devs to create new and better experiences. A few possibilities:Minting an NFT anywhere, anytime is now a reality because secure transactions on a phone can be easily authorized thanks to the secure partition between a user’s keys and the software and hardware levels of a phone. Individuals can transact for goods and services with their securely held digital assets across millions of traditional contactless terminals as well as the growing decentralized Solana Pay payments network.Play web3 games on Solana from anywhere, and keep funds safe and secure with Seed Vault. Users can now manage trading risk while on the go more easily and effectively thanks to an improved user experience possible with native DeFi dApps. Consumers can participate in token-gated mobile commerce experiences based on their digital assets and the secure communications between a wallet, Seed Vault, and a dApp. Creators and developers can establish direct relationships with users through their dApps without intermediaries collecting data and extracting fees thanks to the distribution of the Solana dApp Store. Demand for a mobile-first, open source, blockchain-based mobile development environment can be seen in the early supporters of the Solana Mobile Stack:Coral co-founder Armani Ferrante: “Coral is a next-gen wallet where you can dynamically bring together and manage all of your digital assets, and now, by integrating with Solana Mobile Stack, we’re enabling developers to build mobile-first experiences and, by releasing through the dapp store, we’ll get to directly connect xNFTs to users, and run xNFTs on mobile.”Kiyomi / OpenEra co-founder Irvin Cardenas: “NFTs will become an integral part of our lives. In order for Web3 to reach the mainstream, we need to enable digital assets such as NFTs to be used in our daily lives with our mobile devices in ways that are more seamless, interactive, and engaging. But, most importantly, in ways that neither compromise on security nor bend to traditional intermediary business models. Solana Mobile Stack and especially Seed Vault shows not only that this is possible but also that this is a reality today.”Magic Eden CEO and co-founder Jack Lu: “We want to create the best mobile experiences for our users and are delighted that Solana’s mobile stack will unlock new potential use cases. NFTs are becoming increasingly immersive—people talk about them and showcase them in their real lives. Interacting with NFTs should not occur in a vacuum on a laptop. The future is mobile. We’re excited to support Solana’s project with our Android app.”  Okay Bears co-founder Kais: “Our Okay Bears community connects many hearts across the planet each day. Our members are incredibly diverse, and so are the devices they use. When designing our new products, we worked with Ikonick and Shopify to ensure a beautiful token-gated experience for all of our holders. We’re excited about the Solana Mobile Stack, and its potential to help grow our Okay Bears message.”Orca co-founder Grace “Ori” Kwan: “Orca aims to be the most user-friendly trading experience in DeFi, and we see a huge opportunity to extend that to a new generation of users through mobile. The Solana Mobile stack, including the Seed Vault and Mobile Wallet Adapter, offers the speed, security, and responsiveness needed to make that dream a reality.”Phantom CEO and co-founder Brandon Millman: "As the leading web3 wallet on Solana, we prioritize creating clean, simple, and secure transaction flows. Solana Mobile Stack represents a big advancement for seed management and native transaction signing, both of which elevate the user experience on mobile."StepN Chief Revenue Officer Mable Jiang: “Saga will enable a more open experience for users to interact with StepN from different non-custodial wallets. With Saga, our users could choose whichever frontend they want to trade on very seamlessly. Further, we’re excited about creating new opportunities for our users with a richer mobile native experience made possible with Solana Mobile Stack.”To further accelerate development of native mobile dApps, Solana Foundation also announced today $10 million in ecosystem development grants for developers building on Solana Mobile Stack. The grants will help jumpstart a revolution that should have begun long ago but that is critical now if web3 is to advance beyond the desktop web browser.

The event brought together a who’s who of the people, groups, and communities all building new tools and use cases for DAOs on Solana.“One of the magical things about this hacker house… [is] you had a niche focus and the right people to fit that niche,” said Dean Pappas, a core contributor to Grape. That led to an explosion of creativity and, as he put it, “really cool projects.”“I try to spend my time on what I’m very passionate about,” Pappas said, “and it’s mostly digital governance.”AthensDAO. Picture by Alevtina Yakovenko.It makes sense that Grape would host a house for DAOs – it’s in their DNA. Grape is a tokenized community that acts as a one-stop shop for building a community on Solana. Pappas said Solana is ideal for DAOs because “to experiment in governance and think about all these new ideas, these wacky things, you need very cheap transactions, they need to happen fast, and you need a very good user experience.” The Grape DAO is split into several subDAO councils — such as NFTs, gaming, evaluating bounties, and more — that focus on communities in specific areas. All the councils use Realms or Squads, common Solana governance tools. “It is the best expression of what a decentralized community looks like,” Pappas said.After attending mtnDAO — a long-form, community-driven incubator and hacker house held in Salt Lake City last winter — the Grape team was inspired to host one of their own with a specific focus on governance, closer to where many of the Solana DAO builders were located in Europe. And when the Hacker House X grant program was unveiled, they applied and received support from the Solana Foundation.And once the house got started, the 150 builders really went wild. In addition to new projects from Civic, Gilder, and others, the members of AthensDAO formed their own DAO. “The idea behind the AthensDAO DAO is to make sure that we can perpetually do this,” Pappas said. “What's really cool about the formation of that DAO is the only people who are part of that DAO were physically there.”What’s next? Pappas is focused on building the structure for AthensDAO DAO so they can host a future event.

We will, together, put back the pieces of all the blockchain concepts by uncovering the true purpose of wallets.Hint: Wallets are not here to show your losses in a bear market 😅, they are here to access the blockchain and build!💰 Puzzle Piece 1: The Balance Myth🤫 Tell you a secret, wallets are misleading. They do not store your crypto. In fact, they do not hold anything. So why do we need even them in dapps and blockchain?Skeptical? Take a look at this: https://explorer.solana.com/address/E35325pbtxCRsA4uVoC3cyBDZy8BMpmxvsvGcHNUa18k?cluster=devnet. If my crypto were stored inside a wallet, how come you can just look up what's inside my wallet on the Internet?Why am I starting to talk about wallet balance? You may ask. Because the "wallet" term is misleading! For a casual crypto holder, that notion of token storage might be enough. But as devs, this does not make sense at all. So let's debunk all the myths about wallets by investigating how data and balances are stored.Your wallet balance is stored on the blockchain, not inside your Phantom app, not inside your nano ledger. So it is just data that you can query from the blockchain, and anyone can see it!Earlier, I used the Solana explorer to check my wallet SOL balance. We can retrieve data about a wallet by identifying it by its public key.Let's update our definition of wallets:A wallet can be identified by a public key (its address).A wallet balance is just data stored on the blockchain.⛓ Puzzle Piece 2: BlockchainLet's continue to unroll the thread. We have established that balance is stored on the blockchain and not inside your computer. The next exciting trail we could follow is to ask ourselves how data, in general, is stored in the blockchain.Millions dollars FX Effect zoom into the blockchain pieceTo understand why we need wallets, we first need to understand how data is stored in blockchains.But first, let's take a step back and compare how data is stored in a web2 world:In web2, your data is siloed inside a company's server, and the data is handled by the company. So if tomorrow they decide to delete for censorship or mistakenly destroy your data, it can happen! (That's not a pro blockchain comment, it is just a fact 😅).Now, let's compare it to how data is stored in a blockchain:A blockchain is a distributed ledger:A blockchain is not one single thing. It is a swarm of servers, like 🐝Altogether, these servers represent "a blockchain," like a beehive 👁‍🗨These servers belong to no one or rather anyone.Anyone can be part of the blockchain, and you can use your grandma's laptop as one of these servers.All the nodes store a copy of the data.Actually, your grandma's hardware is not probably gonna cut it, but you got my point!💡 Think[ ] Does a blockchain necessarily need to be on the Internet?[ ] What is the problem with sharing data with anyone?✍️ Puzzle Piece 3: SigningIf we recap what we just learned about blockchains, all nodes contain a copy of your data. I don't know for you, but something is bugging me here...It means anyone from your best friend to your worse enemy can use their computer to make a node and thus own your data!Since data is shared by everyone, how do we avoid anarchy and people modifying other people's data or cheating the system:If an Instagram Clone were built on the blockchain, you would not want anyone to start modifying or deleting your photos, would you?Or, if we were making a Paypal version on the blockchain, how do we make sure that someone doesn't withdraw money from your account? After all, the data (balance) is duplicated and spread between everyone.Let's take the example of a wallet balance, this time we gonna zoom inside a blockchain node:Let's say we have 3 protagonists, Claire, Jay, and Brian. Claire happily sends 5 SOL to both Jay and Brian. But Brian (the evil guy in my story) wants more than 5 SOL. So he pretends to be Claire and asks the blockchain to send an additional 10 SOL to himself.What actually prevents him from doing this?If we were doing web2, you would be saying, well, we can check if the user is signed in, and if they are signed in, we can check if the balance's owner is indeed the user; there are two problems:There is no "session"; the blockchain does not track who is currently "signed in."Earlier, when we verified the wallet balance, we used the wallet public key; the public key is, well ...public; you could use my public key and pretend to be me.Enough teasing. What's the solution?Yes! The key is signing using the private key! We can "password protect our data" without communicating the password, thanks to asymmetric cryptography magic.What's asymmetric? Think SSH keys.Can't wrap your head around it? Well, just think about the real world. For example, if a malicious imposter wants to withdraw money from your bank account, he would need your signature to do it. Well, that's precisely the same here: any modification to data identified by a public key also needs to be signed by the corresponding private key.Yes, there was a world like that when mobile banking did not exist.That's the true nature of wallets!! They are here to sign access to data. They are signatures or stamps.That's a whole different paradigm here. In web2, authentication and authorization were handled by the server. While in web3, this is done directly by cryptography with keys in your own hand!Congrats! You discovered the nature of trustless and decentralized systems.📝 Puzzle Piece 4: TransactionWe just uncovered the true nature of wallets just above. But what exactly do we sign? Private keys are used to sign transactions. A transaction is how we can ask a blockchain to do something.And the good thing for us is that blockchains are all ears to receive orders. Grossly speaking, a blockchain, or more precisely a blockchain node, stores logs or journals. They contain a very long list of orders (transactions). These transactions all together represent the state of the world. That's why we call blockchain state machines:Maverick sends 10 SOL to Iceman.Claire sends 5 SOL to Laura.Michael B. buys Wakanda NFT.Blockchain actually stores a chain of blocks. Transactions are bundled into blocks. But that's a story for another time.How do permission and signing actually work? Let's say Brian tries to impersonate Claire to send himself some extra SOL from Claire's wallet (Remember? Wallet Addresses are public).Solana can do much more than Transfer Tokens, but the same logic applies to every action, especially for modifying data, where you need to prove that you have the permission to do so. Thus you need to sign that action (transaction).💡 ThinkWhen do we need to sign transactions?And when do we not need to sign?... (don't look below before trying!)We need to sign when we mutate data. If we create or change data, we are supposed to have the authority to do so.We do not need to sign when just reading data.👛 Puzzle Piece 5: Wallet AppsAnd finally, to complete the circle, let's talk about wallet apps such as Phantom or Solflare. As you now understand, the secret sauce to the world of blockchain is really about the public key and the signing using the private key.Wallets Apps are really just apps regardless of if it is a mobile wallet, a browser extension, or a desktop app, it really is just an app.These apps just wrap around your keys and add UX niceties such as:Storing your private key encrypted and with a password lock.Adding a recovery passphrase to restore the key.Fetching data from the blockchain to display your wallet's balance.Letting you swap a token by connecting with exchanges.Etc.An example of how the recovery and balance feature work:As you can see, the essential data live in the blockchain. Wallets are just convenience vaults that store your private key encrypted. This is just standard industry encryption and has nothing to do with the blockchain. The most important feature it provides really is signing using the private key.🌀 Putting things back in orderData is stored in a swarm of servers (nodes); these validators form the blockchain.Everyone can be a validator node. For this reason, data can be accessed by anyone.Changes in a blockchain happen with directives: instructions/transactions.To avoid chaos, we need a way to determine who can change what: this is where signing comes into play.Thanks to cryptography, we can sign a transaction (change) using a public/private key pair: this stamp (or signature) allows us to "password lock" some data without communicating the password to the world.A blockchain is a state machine that stores an infinite list of records, logs, or journals of every transaction. The blockchain verifies access to data by checking a transaction signature.That's why wallets exist! To authenticate and authorize access by signing with a private key!A wallet is purely a convenience we created to wrap the private key and add niceties such as; securely storing the private key (with a password lock) or showing the token account balance. So yes, wallets store an encrypted version of your private key.You can totally interact with the blockchain without a wallet app like Solflare or Phantom! It would just be a harrowing user experience. ;)So here you have it, public/private key pairs provide a way for the blockchain to identify you and make sure you got the permission to do what you claim you should be able to do!Wallets are called wallets because the first usage was to lock your balance historically. But in a smart contracts world, it is still about locking your data, not just balances. If anything, wallets should really be called stamps or signature pens! ✍️.What's Next?Do you want to start building on Solana?  A gentle introduction to Solana: https://solana.com/news/solana-scaffold-part-1-wallet-adapterTutorials: https://soldev.app/Going FurtherBlockchain and block chainAt 10000 feet, blockchain in the macro term is a swarm of servers, validators nodes.At 100 feet, a blockchain node contains a chain of blocks.At 1 mm, a block bundles a list of transactions/instructionsBack to 10000 feet, a blockchain is a swarm of nodes that synchronize their chain of blocks.The term blockchain originates from the invention of blocks that are chained together. But in general, when we say blockchain, we think about the whole swarm of nodes, because everyone is supposed to be a copy of another node. So they are all the same.AccountsI haven't mentioned precisely how data are stored. In the Solana world, everything is stored in accounts. If Linux stores data into files, Solana stores data into accounts like a file system. While files have a filename, accounts have a public address:So your SOL balance is actually stored in an account whose public address is your public key!Modification access to that account is locked by the corresponding private key signature!AuthenticationWhen you connect your wallet to a dapp. What does connecting a wallet really do? You are not "connecting" anything, actually. It just gives your public key to the dapp. As we said earlier, to prove that you own the public key, the dapp needs to ask you to sign a message. You probably have seen this in some dapps, where you would have two popups:One for connecting the wallet.Another one to sign a message.Written by mwrites" }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :", by Solana FoundationSee all newsSolana Ventures and Solana Foundation announced today a dedicated $100 million investment and grant fund in Korea to accelerate development and activity across all web3 verticals but with a particular focus on game studios, gamefi, NFTs, and DeFi. “The future of web3 is being built right now,” said Matthew Beck, Head of Solana Ventures. “Korea-based entrepreneurs building on Solana are helping lead the way forward and today’s announcement further solidifies our commitment to the region and its founders as they create high quality, fun and dynamic on-chain experiences.”Korea has always been at the forefront of the games industry from pioneering mobile games,  free-to-play games and esports, as well as establishing a dynamic web3 ecosystem, all of which has paved the way for this dedicated fund, the first geographic-focused fund from Solana Ventures, the strategic venture investment arm of Solana Labs, and Solana Foundation. “We have been working with Korean developers and actively investing in the ecosystem for some time now, which has helped us build a deeper understanding of the Korean market,” said Johnny B. Lee, General Manager of Games, Solana Foundation. “Korea is at the forefront of web3 game design and development and we are focused on helping even more builders in Korea bring their ideas to reality.” The Solana blockchain is designed for high performance use cases like payments, gaming, social networking, and finance. Solana is energy efficient – a single transaction consumes about the same amount of energy as three Google searches – and transacts at the same speeds as the internet, while still being highly decentralized and accessible for both new users and new developers.“Solana’s speed, efficiency, and low costs are helping it become the first choice for developers around the world,” said Anatoly Yakovenko, co-founder of Solana. “Developers are the ones who will bring aboard billions of people to blockchain through great experiences and innovative approaches that show off the power of decentralization on Solana.” Korea will be a critical hub for the Solana ecosystem in this regard. Support in Korea from Solana Ventures and Solana Foundation, along with key Korea-based advisors, will entail capital and localized product and engineering support for developers, teams and companies building on Solana. “Korea has passionate, excited builders looking to build in a big way in web3 and currently seeking the best blockchain to build on for the long term,” said Solana Foundation Executive Director Dan Albert. “We want to help them see the opportunity on Solana and grow the Solana ecosystem.”Beyond the new fund, the inaugural Solana x Jump Hacker House in Seoul will take place from Aug. 3 - 7 at S Factory.

Over the next four and a half hours, validator operators worked to identify the point of furthest progress and collectively instituted a restart of the network, which resulted in durable nonce transactions being temporarily disabled. Block production resumed at 21:00 UTC the same day, and network operators continued to restore client services over the next several hours.Note: This issue was unrelated to improvements in 1.10 and 1.11. You can read more about these forthcoming improvements here. What caused the outage?A runtime bug triggered by the durable nonce transactions feature allowed, under a specific set of circumstances, for a failed durable nonce transaction to be processed twice. This led to nondeterminism, when a validator processed the transaction a second time and some nodes rejected the subsequent block, while others accepted it. Critically, more than 33% of validators accepted the block, but that number fell short of the 66% required to reconcile the nondeterminism. How are nonce transactions supposed to work, and how are they different from normal transactions?Solana utilizes parallel processing of non-overlapping transactions to greatly improve throughput. Networks that process transactions serially can use an incrementing nonce; Solana uses a different method to ensure transactions are not processed twice. For normal transactions, which make up over 99.99% of transactions on the Solana blockchain,  the network utilizes a recent block hash and maintains a record of processed transactions within that window to ensure that duplicates are not processed. Because durable nonce transactions are designed to not expire, they require a different mechanism to prevent double processing, and are processed serially. Such transactions use an on-chain value specific to each account that is rotated every time a durable nonce transaction is processed. After the value is rotated, the same durable nonce transaction should not be able to be processed again. What happened?The processing of a durable nonce transaction in a specific set of circumstances revealed a bug in the runtime that prevented the network from advancing. This bug required the durable nonce transaction to have failed, and would not have been triggered by a successful transaction. The durable nonce transaction was processed while its blockhash was still recent enough for the transaction to be processed as a normal transactionSeeing a recent blockhash, the runtime assumed it was processing a normal transaction, not a durable nonce transactionThis transaction failed and since it was not processed as a durable transaction, processing did not advance the on-chain nonce value as intendedBecause the failed transaction was successfully added to a block, its transaction fees were paidAfter the durable transaction was processed once and failed, it was still able to be processed again as a durable transaction because the nonce value it referenced had not been advanced and was still usable. After the failed transaction was processed, but before the nonce was used again, the user resubmitted the same transaction for processing. This resubmission activated the bug in the runtime.  The failed durable nonce transaction was re-submitted to the clusterThe block producer incorrectly accepted this transaction into the block it was building, because the nonce value on-chain had not been advancedWhen validators validated the block, a portion found the new block included a transaction that had previously been processed, caused by the inclusion of this durable nonce transaction.One set of validators rejected the block, while another set accepted the block, because the previous instance of the transaction was no longer in their recently processed cache.Critically, more than 33% of validators accepted the block, but that number fell short of the 66% required to reconcile the nondeterminism. What is being done?The durable nonce transaction feature was disabled in releases v1.9.28/v1.10.23 to prevent the network from halting if the same situation were to arise again. Durable nonce transactions will not process until the mitigation has been applied, and the feature re-activated in a forthcoming release." }{ "prompt": "prompt", "completion" :"Solana keeps accelerating with ecosystem-born innovations like xNFTsRead articleAnnouncing real time emissions measurement on the Solana blockchainRead articleHelium upgrades to Solana, establishes a new foundation for its futureRead articleRelated TopicsNFTEnergy Use ReportsReportsAnnouncing the Breakpoint Global Fellows ProgramRead articleNeed ideas for the IGNITION Hackathon?
