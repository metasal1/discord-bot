    "Question": "Are NFTs just paying for a jpeg? Can’t I just save a copy?",
    "Answer": "No. The most important feature of NFTs is that they are unique – and the uniqueness is recognized by everyone else on the blockchain. An NFT can really be anything, such as a profile picture, item in a video game, short looping animation, a video, a photo, a loan, or proof you bought a ticket to a concert!"
