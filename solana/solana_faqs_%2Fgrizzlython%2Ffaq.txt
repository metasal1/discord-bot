    "question": "How will projects be judged?",
    "answer": "Grizzlython project submissions will be judged on a variety of factors. After projects are submitted, they are evaluated by the team of judges to determine a shortlist based on code and their presentation or video. As Grizzlython is intended to be a speed run through the launch of a new project, it's important that all participants spend time finessing their marketing and presentation, as well their code. All projects will be reviewed and judges will be consulting these questions as they evaluate: Functionality, Potential Impact, Novelty, UX, Open-source, and Business Plan. After judges complete individual evaluations, the hackathon organizers will sync with the judges to choose the winners based on the project's weighted scores. Winners of the event will be announced within a month of the hackathon submission date."

However, projects will only be judged on the code and work produced during the open and close dates of Grizzlython (Feb. 2 - March 14, 2023). If you participated in Sandstorm and are building an entirely new product, you are also eligible to participate and win Grizzlython prizes."
