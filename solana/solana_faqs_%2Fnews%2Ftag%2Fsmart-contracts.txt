    "question": "How do smart contracts work on Solana's Proof of History based blockchain?",
    "answer": "Solana's blockchain is based on a Proof of History consensus algorithm, which makes use of a special type of data structure called a Verifiable Delay Function (VDF). This VDF is used to timestamp transactions and create a unique and immutable record of each transaction on the blockchain. Smart contracts on Solana's blockchain are written in the Rust programming language to take advantage of the high performance memory management for smart contracts, allowing developers to create more sophisticated applications."
