Q1: What is Solana's network architecture?
A1: Solana is a high-performance permissionless network that employs a distributed systems approach to scaling blockchain. It features innovations such as Proof of History, a clock for blockchain, and Loom, a data-encoding technique for time.

Q2: What is Proof of History?
A2: Proof of History is a new approach to blockchain scaling that encodes time as data. It is used in Solana's network architecture to enable faster transaction times and greater scalability.

Q3: What is Loom?
A3: Loom is a data-encoding technique for time that is used in Solana's network architecture. It is designed to enable faster transaction times and greater scalability.
