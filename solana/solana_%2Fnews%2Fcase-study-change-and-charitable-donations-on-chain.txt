    "question": "What are the advantages of using Change's donation system?",
    "answer": "Change's donation system allows for transparency to be built into the smart contract set-up. Community members will be able to look up the nonprofit’s wallet and see its entire history of donations and also see what happens to the donation after they make it. Additionally, Solana's cost-effectiveness – transactions cost a fraction of a penny – also means that more of the donations end up in the hands of the non-profit."
